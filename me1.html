=============

Mass Effect is the first in a trilogy of games created by BioWare, award-
winning developer of such RPGs as "Knights of the Old Republic" and "Baldur's 
Gate."  It takes place in the year 2183, as humanity begins to take its first 
steps on the galactic stage, interacting with new alien races and settling 
uncharted worlds.  You play as Lieutenant Commander Shepard, a promising 
young officer in the Systems Alliance Navy who has just been assigned to the 
SSV Normandy--the most advanced starship humans have ever created.

Mass Effect was released for the Xbox 360 in North America on November 20, 
2007, and for the PC on May 28, 2008.

<a id="12back">Background                                                            </a>
===========

In 2148 AD, humanity discovered a small cache of highly advanced alien 
technology buried deep beneath the surface of Mars.  The creators of this 
technology--known as the Protheans--went extinct nearly 50,000 years ago, 
leaving little evidence of their existence behind.  The discovery of this 
technology led humans to develop faster-than-light travel, allowing rapid 
expansion throughout the solar system.

Within a year humanity uncovered another piece of Prothean technology, a 
dormant mass relay that had been encased in the ice-dwarf Charon.  Once 
activated, this relay allowed instantaneous travel across thousands of light 
years to other mass relays in different parts of the galaxy.  Humanity 
immediately began using this technology to colonize far-off star systems.  
This same year, the Systems Alliance was formed by the largest governments on 
Earth to serve as the spearhead of humanity's expansion.

In 2157, the Alliance made first contact with an alien species known as the 
turians.  This resulted in the First Contact War, as the next several months 
saw skirmishes between the turians and Earth's Systems Alliance fleets.  In 
the largest battle of the war, the turians crushed the garrison on the human 
colony of Shanxi, before ultimately being driven off by the Alliance Second 
Fleet.  This conflict drew the attention of the Citadel Council, a governing 
body that maintained peace and stability throughout much of the galaxy.  They 
intervened in the conflict and brokered a peace agreement between humans and 
turians.

Humanity continued its rapid expansion, and in 2165 it was granted an embassy 
on the Citadel, the political and economic heart of the civilized galactic 
community.  This angered another race of aliens, the batarians, who had come 
into competition with humanity over territory in an undeveloped region of 
space known as the Skyllian Verge.

Frustrated with the Council's refusal to halt human expansion, the batarians 
closed their embassy on the Citadel and ultimately launched a surprise attack 
on the human colony of Elysium.  The attack failed however, and in 
retaliation the Alliance raided the batarian criminal base on Torfan in 2178.  
Despite taking heavy losses, the Alliance soldiers utterly exterminated the 
inhabitants.

The year is now 2183, and the SSV Normandy--the most advanced starship ever 
created by the Alliance--is being put through its paces.  Aboard is Commander 
Shepard, a talented young officer who will soon embark on a galaxy-spanning 
adventure with the fate of the known universe hanging in the balance...

<a id="13acha">CHARACTER CREATION                                                    </a>
------------------

When you start a new game of Mass Effect, you can begin with the default 
version of Commander Shepard, or you can create your own.  Creating a custom 
character allows you to alter your version of Commander Shepard in a number 
of ways, as detailed below.

You must first select a gender for your character and give him or her a name.  
The default male name is "John," and the default female name is "Jane."  For 
the purposes of in-game dialogue and continuity, the last name cannot be 
changed.

After selecting a name, you must assign a background and personality to your 
character.  This is a two-step process:

    The first step is to select your pre-service history.  This determines 
    your character's background before he or she joined the Alliance 
    military.  This choice has a small effect on your alignment (which will 
    be explained later), and opens up one optional assignment for you to 
    complete.

        Spacer:        "Both of your parents were in the Alliance military.  
                       Your childhood was spent on ships and stations as they 
                       transferred from posting to posting, never staying in 
                       one location for more than a few years.  Following in 
                       your parents' footsteps, you enlisted at the age of 
                       eighteen."

                       Alignment Bonus: +10 Paragon

                       Assignment: "Citadel: Old, Unhappy, Far-Off Things," 
                       in which Commander Shepard deals with a drunken ex-
                       marine who was emotionally scarred by the atrocities 
                       he witnessed on Mindoir.

        Colonist:      "You were born and raised on Mindoir, a small border 
                       colony in the Attican Traverse. When you were sixteen, 
                       slavers raided Mindoir, slaughtering your family and 
                       friends. You were saved by a passing Alliance patrol, 
                       and you enlisted with the military a few years later."

                       Alignment Bonus: +5 Paragon
                                        +5 Renegade

                       Assignment: " Citadel: I Remember Me," in which 
                       Commander Shepard is asked to speak with a fellow 
                       colonist who was traumatized by the events on Mindoir.

        Earthborn:     "As an Earthborn, you had a rough childhood in the 
                       slums of Earth, and have a gritty edge to your 
                       personality."

                       Alignment Bonus: +10 Renegade

                       Assignment: "Citadel: Old Friends," in which Commander 
                       Shepard is confronted by a member of his/her former 
                       gang and asked for a favor.

    Next you select your psychological profile, for which there are again 
    three possible choices.  By the start of the game, your character has 
    made a name for him/herself in military circles, and your choice here 
    determines precisely how this came to be.  Individuals in the game will 
    sometimes recognize you from your past exploits and react accordingly.

    Additionally, for each psychological profile there is an optional 
    assignment that is affected.  However, unlike the pre-service history 
    selections, these assignments are available to all players.

        Sole Survivor: "During your service, a mission you were on went 
                       horribly wrong. Trapped in an extreme survival 
                       situation, you had to overcome physical torments and 
                       psychological stresses that would have broken most 
                       people. You survived while all those around you fell, 
                       and now you alone are left to tell the tale."

                       Alignment Bonus: +5 Paragon
                                        +5 Renegade

                       Assignment: "UNC: Dead Scientists," in which Commander 
                       Shepard encounters a fellow survivor of the massacre 
                       on Akuze.

        War Hero:      "Early in your military career you found yourself 
                       facing an overwhelming enemy force. You risked your 
                       own life to save your fellow soldiers and defeat the 
                       enemy despite the impossible odds.  Your bravery and 
                       heroism have earned you medals and recognition from 
                       the Alliance fleet."

                       Alignment Bonus: +10 Paragon

                       Assignment: "UNC: Espionage Probe," in which Commander 
                       Shepard confronts the mastermind of the attack he/she 
                       is famous for defeating.

        Ruthless:      "Throughout your military career, your have held fast 
                       to one basic rule: get the job done. You've been 
                       called cold, calculating, and brutal. Your reputation 
                       for ruthless efficiency makes your fellow soldiers 
                       wary of you. But when failure is not an option, the 
                       military always goes to you first."

                       Alignment Bonus: +10 Renegade

                       Assignment: "UNC: Major Kyle," in which Commander 
                       Shepard must stop a dangerous cult led by his/her 
                       former commanding officer.

    These two selections create a matrix of nine possible backgrounds for 
    your character, each of which is detailed below.  You may use this list 
    to select your desired combination of pre-service history and 
    psychological profile.

        Spacer / Sole Survivor:

            "Both of your parents were in the Alliance military. Your 
            childhood was spent on ships and stations as they transferred 
            from posting to posting. Following in your parents' footsteps, 
            you enlisted at the age of eighteen.

            One of your first missions was an expedition to investigate 
            Akuze, a lush world on the outskirts of Alliance space that had 
            suddenly dropped out of contact. Arriving on the surface, your 
            patrol found the settlement intact, but there were no survivors.

            At nightfall, the thresher maws struck - mindless abominations of 
            teeth and tentacles that rose from beneath the earth. Constant 
            gunfire couldn't drown out the shrieks of your fellow soldiers as 
            they were dragged down to a gruesome death.

            Fifty marines died on Akuze. You were the only one to make it 
            back to the landing zone alive. A monument on the planet 
            commemorates the massacre, a grim reminder of the price humanity 
            must pay as they spread throughout the stars."

        Spacer / War Hero:

            "Born into a naval family, you spent your childhood on ships and 
            stations. You moved from posting to posting as your parents were 
            reassigned. You enlisted in the Alliance military yourself on the 
            day you turned eighteen.

            You were on shore leave at Elysium when the first wave of the 
            Skyllian Blitz struck. A massive coalition force of slavers, 
            crime syndicates, and batarian warlords attacked the human 
            colony, determined to wipe it out.

            You rallied the civilian inhabitants, leading them in their 
            desperate fight to hold off the invaders. When enemy troops broke 
            through the colony's defenses, you single-handedly held them off 
            and sealed the breach.

            After hours of brutal fighting, reinforcements finally arrived 
            and the enemy broke ranks and fled. Because of your actions, 
            Elysium was saved, and you are regarded throughout the Alliance 
            as a true hero."

        Spacer / Ruthless:

            stations. You moved from posting to posting as your parents were 
            reassigned, and it was only natural you would follow in their 
            footsteps by enlisting in the Alliance military when you came of 
            age.

            After several years of service, you joined the campaign to rid 
            the Skyllian Verge of batarian slavers and other criminal 
            elements. The final battle came when Alliance forces laid siege 
            to Torfan, a slaver base built miles below the surface of a 
            desolate moon. The superiority of the human fleet was wasted in 
            the assault on the underground bunker, but you led a corps of 
            elite ground troops into the heart of the enemy base.

            Nearly three-quarters of your own squad perished in the vicious 
            close-quarters fighting... a cost you were willing to pay to make 
            sure not a single slaver made it out of Torfan alive."

            family were slaughtered. A passing Alliance patrol rescued you, 
            but all you loved was destroyed.

            You enlisted with the Alliance military, eventually volunteering 
            to go to Akuze, a colony that had mysteriously dropped out of

            surviving in the hidden underbelly of the megatropolises of 
            humanity's home world.

            Eager to find a better life, you joined the Alliance military 
            when you came of age. You were assigned to the campaign to rid 
            the Skyllian Verge of batarian slavers and other criminal 
            elements. The final battle came when Alliance forces laid siege 
            to Torfan, a slaver base built miles below the surface of a 
            desolate moon. The superiority of the human fleet was wasted in 
            the assault on the underground bunker, but you led a corps of 
            elite ground troops into the heart of the enemy base.

            Nearly three-quarters of your own squad perished in the vicious 
            close-quarters fighting, a cost you were willing to pay to make 
            sure not a single slaver made it out of Torfan alive."

    * The Earthborn / Sole Survivor background is chosen for the default 
      Commander Shepard.

After creating a character profile, you must select your class from the six 
types available to you.  This is a very important selection, as it determines 
what weapons and abilities you will have access to.

There are three primary classes in Mass Effect: Soldiers, Engineers, and 
Adepts.  Soldiers are combat specialists: They are the only class with access 
to heavy armor, and they have the ability to train in the use of any weapon 
type.  Engineers specialize in non-combat abilities like unlocking doors and 
containers, and in sabotaging enemy weapons and shields.  Adebts are biotic 
characters that can forcefully move enemies and objects, and are best at 
disabling enemies and controlling crowds.

        Soldier:       "The Soldier is a tough warrior, able to deal with a 
                       range of combat situations.  The Soldier gets improved 
                       health, has the widest selection of weapons, and is 
                       eventually able to wear heavy armor.  Gameplay focus 
                       is on getting into the thick of the fight, picking the 
                       right weapon for tactical situations, and outlasting 
                       opponents."
                           
                       Starting Talents:   Assault Rifles
                                           Assault Training
                                           Combat Armor (Medium)
                                           Pistols	

                       Unlockable Talents: Combat Armor (Heavy)

                                           Sniper Rifles

        Engineer:      "The Engineer is a tech specialist, able to quickly 
                       and easily manipulate the environment with specific 
                       talents.  Gameplay focus is on shaping the battlefield 
                       during combat, healing the party, and debuffing 
                       enemies (disabling weapons and lowering shields)."

                       Starting Talents:   Decryption
                                           Electronics
                                           First Aid

        Adept:         "The Adept is the ultimate biotic, able to affect the 
                       physical world with the power of the mind.  They can 
                       use biotics to violently manipulate objects in the 
                       environment, including nearby enemy targets.  Gameplay 
                       focus is on disabling and debuffing enemies while 
                       dealing massive amounts of damage."

                       Starting Talents:   Barrier
                                           Basic Armor (Light)
                                           Throw

                                           Stasis

The remaining three classes are hybrids of the first three.  The Infiltrator 
combines the Soldier and Engineer, the Vanguard combines the Soldier and 
Adept, and the Sentinel combines the Engineer and Adept.

Vanguards have access to weapons and armor training, but don't have the range 
of biotic abilities open to Adepts.  Similarly, Infiltrators gain weapons and 
armor training as well, but lack the range of debuffs possessed by Engineers.  
The most supporting class is the Sentinel, which offers a mix of tech and 
biotic powers, but lacks weapon or armor talents.

        Infiltrator:   "The Infiltrator is a tech-savvy warrior, able to win 
                       battles by quickly disabling and killing enemies.  
                       These soldiers focus on unlocking alternate routes, 
                       gaining access to good equipment, and obtaining an 
                       advantageous position over enemies in combat."

        Vanguard:      "The Vanguard is a powerful combatant, able to combine 
                       the offensive powers of the Adept and the Soldier.  
                       They have access to various weapons and armor, as well 
                       as biotics.  Gameplay focus is on taking down enemies 
                       with quick and brutal force.

                       Starting Talents:   Assault Training

                                           Tactical Armor (Light/Medium)

        Sentinel:      "The Sentinel is the most flexible class, able to 
                       combine tech and biotics to manipulate the 
                       environment, disable and track enemies, or defend the 
                       party.  Gameplay focus is on protecting the party 
                       using kinetic barriers and healing it with advanced 
                       medical training."

                       Starting Talents:   Barrier

                                           Stasis

Finally you are ready to customize your character's appearance.  You can 
choose to use the default versions of Commander Shepard, or you can adjust 
any aspect of your character's face to your liking.  Use the sliders in each 
section to manipulate a range of facial details.  Female characters have the 
additional option of customizing makeup.

When you are finished, select "Finalize" to begin the game.  Note that once 
you have completed one playthrough of Mass Effect you can begin a new game by 
selecting an existing character.  You will begin the new game with all the 
stats and equipment that your character had at the time the game was 
finished.  Though any accrued Charm or Intimidate slots will be retained, 
your preexisting Paragon and Renegade scores will not carry over.

Additionally, if you have unlocked any weapons or powers through 
achievements, you must select one as a bonus talent for your new character.

-------------------- 

Mass Effect is an Action Role-Playing Video Game (or RPG), meaning you assume 
the role of a fictional character and control his or her actions in a way 
that affects the game and other characters.  As your progress through the 
game you will earn "experience points" (or XP) for your actions.  You gain 
these points by exploring, talking to characters, completing quests, and 
defeating enemies in combat.  The accumulation of these points allows your 
character to "level up," thereby increasing certain characteristics such as 
health.  In Mass Effect you are granted "talent points" after each level up, 
which can be spent to improve your character's abilities.  Many of these 
components are explained in more detail later.


<a id="13ccon">CONVERSATIONS                                                         </a>
-------------

A significant amount of time in Mass Effect is devoted to conversations with 
other characters.  This is done through the "conversation wheel" that appears 
near the bottom of the screen whenever your character has the opportunity to 
say something.  All dialogue in the game is fully voiced, including that of 
Commander Shepard.  Rather than choosing the exact words your character will 
say however, Mass Effect shows you several options on the wheel corresponding 
to general feelings, questions, or emotions.  These short phrases are then 
turned into full lines of dialogue that are spoken by your character.

To select a dialogue response on the Xbox 360, hold the left analog stick in 
the direction of the choice you wish to select, and then press the A button.  
You can also press the X button instead, which will begin your character's 
line immediately, stepping on the lines of any character who is speaking at 
the time.  X is also used to skip dialogue if you wish to do so.  On the PC 
you use the mouse to select dialogue options, and the Spacebar to skip 
dialogue.

The dialogue wheel itself is divided into six sectors.  Choices on the 
wheel's left side usually give you more information about a given topic, 
while choices on the right tend to bring the conversation closer to its 
conclusion.  Additionally, the top of the wheel tends to correspond to the 
Paragon path, where your character makes cooperative and unselfish decisions.  
The bottom of the wheel typically corresponds to the Renegade path, where 
your character makes decisions that are more selfish and impatient.  This is 
not always the case, but it is a good general guide to framing your responses 
during a conversation if you wish to play as an honorable (or merciless) 
character.

Sometimes you will see the option on the middle left to "Investigate."  
Selecting this option brings up more choices for topics of conversation, and 
the orientation of these choices often does not correspond to the Paragon / 
Renegade paths described above.

If you have spent sufficient talent points in the "Charm" or "Intimidate" 
talents, you will sometimes also have the option to persuade characters to 
achieve a nonviolent outcome or to give you additional money, items, or 
information.  These choices appear in the upper and lower left quadrants as 
blue and red dialogue choices respectively.  If you lack sufficient skill in 
these areas, these choices will be grayed out, and you will not have the 
option of using them.


<a id="13dthe">THE MISSION COMPUTER                                                  </a>
--------------------

By pressing the Start Button (or Esc on the PC) you can enter the Mission 
Computer menu.  You access each part of the menu in a similar way to 
selecting dialogue choices during a conversation.

    The Mission Computer allows you access to game details for:

        Codex:     A small encyclopedia of the Mass Effect universe.  As you 
                   play and gain new information the Codex will populate 
                   itself with new articles concerning the planets, 
                   civilizations, and technologies you come across.

        Equipment: View and change your currently equipped weapons, armor, 
                   items, and upgrades.

        Exit Game: Quits the game and returns to the desktop. (PC only)

        Journal:   View your current missions and assignments.  Missions are 
                   essential to the completion of the game.  Assignments are 
                   optional, but typically grant experience points and 
                   other rewards.

        Load:      Load previously saved games.

        Main Menu: Exit the game and return to the main menu. (PC only)

        Map:       Shows a two dimensional overview of your current area.  It 
                   indicates the position of your character as well as known 
                   points of interest, objectives, and other pieces of useful 
                   information.  On the Xbox 360, you can use the left and 
                   right bumpers to zoom in and out for a better view.

        Options:   Change your settings for gameplay, graphics, sound, and 
                   other options.  Notably, you can change the gameplay 
                   difficulty, and toggle visual effects like film grain and 
                   motion blur. (Xbox 360 only)

        Save:      Allows you to save your current progress through the game.  
                   You cannot save in certain situations, such as during 
                   combat and while riding in elevators.

        Settings:  Change your settings for gameplay, graphics, sound, and 
                   other options.  Notably, you can change the gameplay

                   squad members.


<a id="13ecom">COMBAT                                                                </a>
------

The combat in Mass Effect resembles a third-person shooter, but is actually 
powered by an RPG rules set.  You can draw your weapon by pressing the X 
button (Q on the PC) or either of the triggers (mouse buttons on the PC), and 
can holster it by pressing the B button (Q on the PC).

Drawing your weapon enters combat mode, showing a reticule on-screen to 
indicate where your weapon is aimed.  It also displays the status of each 
squad member in the lower left corner of the screen.  The red bar indicates 
the health of each squad member, while the blue boxes indicate the status of 
each character's shields.  More boxes mean greater shield strength, and empty 
boxes mean the shields are depleted.

Radar is displayed in the bottom right corner, and shows enemies as red dots.  
Some enemies can jam your radar, hiding their locations from you.  However, 
certain weapon upgrades can be used to negate this ability.

The right analog stick (or mouse on the PC) is used to aim the target 
reticule.  Holding the left trigger (right mouse button on PC) zooms in for 
more precise aiming, increasing your character's accuracy.  The reticule 
turns orange when it is placed over an enemy or any object that can be 
damaged or destroyed.  Squeezing the right trigger (left mouse button on PC) 
then fires your weapon.  The chance of hitting an enemy and how much damage 
is dealt from your weapon are determined by your stats and equipment.  Your 
chance of hitting an enemy is reduced by holding the trigger for a long 
period of time.  Sustained fire can also overheat your weapon, meaning you 
must wait for it to cool down before using it again.

On the Xbox 360, strategic management is accomplished through the use of two 
combat "wheels."  The first is the "Weapons Wheel" which is accessed by 
holding down the left bumper.  This pauses the action, and allows you to 
select what weapon each member of your squad will use.  All squad members 
carry a pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, and sniper rifle, but each will be 
far more effective with a certain weapon if they have trained in its use.

The second wheel is the "Power Wheel," which is accessed by holding the right 
bumper.  This allows you to access the special abilities of all squad members 
and use them accordingly by aiming using the right analog stick.  A power can 
also be mapped to the right bumper by pressing the X button while using the 
wheel.

On the PC these wheels are replaced by the Tactical HUD, which is accessed by 
holding down the Spacebar.  This screen shows the abilities that are 
available to you and your squad members.  You can use it to select which 
weapons and powers to use, and it also allows you to set your hotkeys for 
each ability by dragging them to the quick slots located in the upper left 
corner.  Here they can be accessed by pressing the appropriate number key, 1 
through 8.


<a id="13fadv">ADVANCING LEVELS                                                      </a>
----------------

As mentioned previously, you gain experience points as you progress through 
the game.  There is a single pool of experience for the entire squad, 
allowing you and your companions to advance at a similar rate.  Each time you 
accumulate a sufficient number of experience points, you will level up, 
granting access to new talent points which you can spend at the Squad screen 
in the Mission Computer.  Your character starts at level 1, and the highest 
possible level is 60.

At the Squad screen you can automatically distribute talent points to the 
selected character, or you can spend them manually on each desired talent.

    Players earn talent points for each new level as follows:

    Level    Shepard Points per Level    Squad Points per Level
      1-5                3                         2
     6-20                2                         2
    21-35                2                         1
    36-60                1                         1

This means that Shepard can earn up to 100 talent points through leveling up, 
while squad members can earn up to 80 points.  However, all characters begin 
with 2 points already allocated, and automatic points in the Charm and 
Intimidate talents can be earned by raising your Paragon and Renegade meters 
to sufficient levels.  This will be explained more later.


<a id="13gthe">THE GALAXY MAP                                                        </a>
--------------

To travel around the galaxy using your advanced starship--the Normandy--you 
must access the galaxy map, located prominently in the center of the command 
deck.

The first level of the galaxy map is the Galaxy Level, which shows all 
available star clusters and nebulae you can visit.  By moving your cursor 
over a selected cluster you can see its name and view the relay path the 
Normandy would take to reach that part of the galaxy.  New clusters and 
systems become available as you complete missions and learn more about the 
galaxy.

After selecting a location, you zoom in to the Cluster Level, which shows all 
known star systems within that cluster.  To explore a star system you must 
travel there by clicking on it and confirming that you wish to travel.

When you have arrived at a new system you will see the System Level, which 
shows all the planets and celestial objects orbiting the star you have 
traveled to.  All planets will have a blue ring showing their orbit.  Other 
objects may be hidden and will require you to move your cursor over them to 
discover their presence.  For example, many asteroid belts have interesting 
asteroids you can examine, and derelict starships and freighters can also be 
found in some systems.  A hidden object can usually be identified by a small 
twinkle of light that appears on occasion.  To find these objects, move your 
cursor over the object and press the appropriate button to scan it.

By selecting a planet, moon, or other object you will zoom in to the 
Planetary Level.  This shows you a view of the planet's surface along with a 
synopsis of important planetary features and information.  Many planets are 
inhospitable to human life, but some can be surveyed for raw materials and 
interesting artifacts, while others can be explored using the Mako.

Collecting, using, and upgrading your equipment is important to your success 
and survival in Mass Effect.  The first pieces of useful equipment are your 
weapons.  Every squad member carries four basic weapon types, and Commander 
Shepard can also throw grenades which detonate automatically after ten 
seconds if not detonated remotely by pressing the grenade button again.

        Pistols:        "Pistols are highly accurate, have little recoil, and 
                        are easy to use when moving.  They are effective at a 
                        variety of ranges, but inflict limited damage."

        Shotguns:       "Shotguns have a slow rate of fire and high recoil, 
                        but inflict massive damage to multiple targets when 
                        fired at close range."

        Assault Rifles: "Assault rifles are the standard armament of most 
                        Soldiers, offering a good balance between firepower, 
                        range, and accuracy."

                        Trainable by: Soldier

        Sniper Rifles:  "Sniper rifles have long range, are highly accurate, 
                        and inflict significant damage.  They have a limited 
                        rate of fire, however, and are practically useless at 
                        close range.

        Grenades:       "Disk-shaped Alliance grenades can glide long 
                        distances and also latch onto targets or flat 
                        surfaces to be remotely detonated.  Only you, as 
                        Commander Shepard, can use grenades."

The next major component is armor, which protects the wearer from 
injury.  Each species uses a different set of armor because of inherent 
differences in physiology.  The one exception is the asari, who can wear 
human armor, and vice versa.

        Light Armor:    "Light armor offers a basic level of protection from 
                        enemy attacks and minimizes the movement penalties 
                        that affect weapon accuracy."

        Medium Armor:   "Medium armor offers an increased level of 
                        protection, but also increases the movement penalties 
                        that affect weapon accuracy."

        Heavy Armor:    "Heavy armor offers the highest level of protection 
                        from enemy fire, but also has the highest movement 
                        penalties affecting weapon accuracy."

                        Wearable by:  Soldier (requires training)

With one exception, all weapons, armors, and grenades can be upgraded to 
enhance their properties.  Upgrades can increase damage, improve shields, and 
more.

To upgrade equipment, access the Equipment screen through the Mission 
Computer (or press I on the PC).  Equip the item you wish to use and press 
the X button to view the Upgrade screen on the Xbox 360, or click the 
appropriate upgrade slot on the PC.  Select the desired upgrades and then 
confirm the upgrade selection.

To modify tech and biotic abilities, special equipment is used:

        Bio-amps:       "Biotics can strengthen their power in specific 
                        disciplines by using amps (amplifiers). These 
                        specially designed devices often come in the form of 
                        small electronic attachments that are worn on a 
                        biotic's ear or the back of their head."

        Omni-tools:     "Omni-tools are multipurpose diagnostic and 
                        minifacturing tools used for a variety of battlefield 
                        tasks, such as hacking, decryption, or repair. They 
                        are equipped by Engineers, Sentinels, and 
                        Infiltrators to make use of their tech talents."

New equipment can be acquired in a number of ways.  As you progress in the 
game and defeat enemies you gain XP, money, and items.  These new items are 
automatically placed in your inventory.  You can also purchase items from 
merchants or take them from containers you find throughout the game.  
Merchants also allow you to purchase increased grenade or medi-gel capacity.

Medi-gel is a universal healing substance that restores the health of all 
squad members when used.  Press the Y button (F on the PC) during combat to 
use medi-gel on your squad.

There is an inventory limit of 150 items, so it is important to keep your 
inventory as unoccupied as is reasonable.  Any weapons, armors, or upgrades 
you or your squad aren't using can be sold for extra money or turned into 
omni-gel.  Omni-gel is useful for opening locked containers and decrypting 
certain electronic devices, provided you have the requisite skill already.

The Squad screen (accessible from the Mission Computer menu) provides 
information about your character and the other characters in your squad, 
including name, class, appearance, level, and use of talent points.  The 
Squad screen can be accessed directly on the PC by pressing the U key.

Each time you accumulate enough experience to gain a new level, all 
characters are granted talent points.  Using the Squad screen, you can assign 
these points in order to improve the abilities of your characters or unlock 
new abilities.

Commander Shepard also has Paragon and Renegade meters shown on this screen.  
These meters are representative of the choices you make throughout the game.  
Generous choices will result in Paragon points, while ruthless choices will 
result in Renegade points.  Either path is acceptable, as you gain bonuses 
for filling either meter. 

        Paragon:  The Paragon scale is colored blue and impacts the Charm 
                  ability.

        Renegade: The Renegade scale is colored red and impacts the 
                  Intimidate ability.

                  10% Bonus: Opens two Intimidate slots

<a id="13jexp">EXPLORING UNCHARTED WORLDS                                            </a>
--------------------------

When you land on a planet, you should first check your Map.  This often 
reveals the locations of many known points of interest.  Anomalies--marked 
with a question mark--usually indicate something interesting to explore.  You 
can also find several deposits of rare materials, which you can acquire if 
you discover them.

When you are done exploring a planet, simply press the X button while in the 
Mako (or from the Map screen) to return to the Normandy.  This is done on the 
PC by pressing the N key.


<a id="13kusi">USING THE MAKO                                                        </a>
--------------

In the cargo hold of the Normandy you can find the M35 Mako, an infantry 
fighting vehicle that can be used to cover long distances quickly and to 
provide cover and direct fire support.  You can use the A button (E on the 
PC) to enter the Mako, and the B button (Q on the PC) to exit it.

The Mako is equipped with a machine gun for dealing with infantry, as well as 
a 155mm cannon for destroying more heavily armored targets.  It also comes 
with jump jets that can be activated using the A button (Spacebar on the PC), 
which allow the operator to deftly jump over obstacles (or incoming enemy 
rockets).

If the Mako becomes damaged from enemy fire, press the Y button (F on the PC) 
to repair it.  Doing so uses 15 omni-gel and requires the Mako to be 
stationary.

It is worth noting that the number of experience points you receive for 
killing enemies in the Mako is one third of that for killing enemies while on 
foot.  If you are concerned with gaining as much experience as possible you 
should still use the Mako for travel, but exit the vehicle when you get close 
enough to engage an enemy.  With some of the tougher enemies you can also use 
the Mako to weaken them, and then finish them off while on foot.

It is helpful to know that enemies aim their attacks at the nose of the Mako.  
You can use this information to position the front of the vehicle behind an 
obstacle, leaving the turret free to return fire.

<a id="21walk">Walkthrough                                                           </a>
============

Please Note:  This guide does not always provide the fastest possible route 
through the game.  It is intended for those who want to enjoy the complete 
Mass Effect experience, and includes many optional items that are not 
required to complete your adventure.  The walkthrough is also not spoiler-
free, as it is intended to provide a reference to players who may be confused 
about certain plot points.

The Walkthrough is divided into three sections.  The first is the Primary 
Mission Walkthrough, detailing the main story in which Shepard must save the 
galaxy.  This section includes some optional components, but these tasks will 
be designated as such and you may skip them at your discretion.

The next section is for Optional Assignments, and details every side mission 
in the game.  Assignments that deviate from the main path will be included in 
this section.

Finally, the last section consists of a brief listing of all possible Codex 
entries and how to acquire them.


<a id="21apri">PRIMARY MISSION WALKTHROUGH                                           </a>
---------------------------

Your adventure begins on the command deck of the SSV Normandy, the most 
advanced System Alliance starship ever created.  You are Commander Shepard, a 
promising officer in the Alliance Navy, who has been tasked with overseeing 
the ship as it is put through its paces...
   This section takes you through the primary mission.  There are many steps 
involved, some of which are optional.


<a id="21a1pr">SECTION 1 - Prologue                                                  </a>


1 - Shakedown
Our story begins as Commander Shepard heads to the front of the Normandy, 
where Joker--the ship's helmsman--has just finished a mass relay jump.  The 
mass relays are thought to be relics of an ancient civilization known as the 
Protheans, and facilitate rapid travel throughout the galaxy.  He relays his 
success to Nihlus Kryik, who is overseeing the operation.  Nihlus is a turian 
Spectre, an elite operative charged with maintaining galactic stability at 
any cost.  When Nihlus leaves, Joker tells Lieutenant Alenko about his 
distrust for Spectres, at which point you have an opportunity to voice an 
opinion.  Your dialogue choices can net you Paragon or Renegade points.  
Choices in the upper part of the dialogue wheel usually correspond with the 
Paragon alignment, while choices on the bottom of the wheel usually 
correspond to the Renegade alignment.  Captain Anderson--the commanding 
officer on the Normandy--comes on the comm and asks you to report to the 
briefing room.

    +2 Paragon - "I agree."
    +2 Renegade - "Cut the chatter!"
    New Mission: "Prologue: On the Normandy"

2 - Pressly (Optional)
On your way back towards the briefing room you can overhear Navigator Pressly 
having a conversation with Chief Engineer Adams.  Speaking with Pressly 
reveals his concerns about the mission: He is worried that Nihlus and 
Anderson are concealing something important from the crew.  Pressly can also 
fill you in on the Normandy's unique stealth systems, which allow it to avoid 
detection by other ships.

3 - Jenkins and Chakwas (Optional)
Outside of the briefing room, Corporal Jenkins is having a conversation with 
Dr. Chakwas.  You can speak with them to learn more about the Spectres, as 
well as Eden Prime--your destination for this mission.

    +2 Paragon - "Relax, Jenkins."
    +2 Renegade - "Part of the job, Doc."

4 - Spectre Training
Enter the briefing room and speak with Nihlus.  He talks briefly about Eden 
Prime before Captain Anderson enters and reveals the true nature of the 
operation: A Prothean beacon was recently unearthed on Eden Prime and the 
Normandy is being sent in to recover it.  The beacon likely contains a wealth 
of information on the Protheans--information that could lead to the 
development of new technologies.  It is vital that the Normandy get the 
beacon back to the Citadel--the seat of galactic government--so that it can't 
fall into the wrong hands.  As it turns out, Nihlus will also be using this 
mission as an opportunity to evaluate you as a possible candidate for the 
Spectres.  Before you reach Eden Prime however, Joker patches through a 
distress signal from the planet's surface, showing an attack by a massive 
spaceship of unknown origin.  Needless to say, this adds urgency to the 
assignment, as you must now find and secure the beacon while helping any 
survivors you find.

    "Prologue: On the Normandy" -> "Prologue: Find the Beacon"


<a id="21a2ed">SECTION 2 - Eden Prime                                                </a>


1 - Touchdown on Eden Prime
You arrive on the planet's surface with Lieutenant Alenko and Corporal 
Jenkins in your squad.  Each of you has only basic equipment.  Head into the 
bog to the north and turn east to find an upgrade kit.  (Note that for Eden 
Prime the compass and map directions do not agree.  Directions listed here 
will follow the map directions.)  Jenkins will identify the nearby gas bags 
which you can use for target practice before moving on.  

2 - The Geth
Proceed west and follow the path over the hill.  You are immediately ambushed 
by a small group of geth recon drones and Jenkins is fatally wounded.  The 
recon drones have weak weapons and shields, but are resistant to biotic 
attacks.  When they are destroyed, check Jenkins' body to confirm his fate.  
Continue north up the hill.  There are three drones at the top you must 
defeat, after which you can find another upgrade kit to the left of the path 
containing some grenades and omni-gel.  Proceed northeast through the woods 
and destroy three more drones.  Off to the left before you exit the woods you 
can find a medical kit to replenish your medi-gel.

    +2 Paragon - "He deserves a burial."
    +2 Renegade - "Forget about him."

3 - Ashley Williams
As you descend the hill you witness a lone soldier being chased by more 
drones.  She turns to see another human impaled on a large spike by two geth 
troopers, which you must now help her defeat.  Speak with the soldier after 
the battle.  She can tell your more about the attack on the colony, and the 
enemy you are facing.  Ashley Williams will now join your squad.  There is an 
upgrade kit to your right, along with a crate containing Scorpion I light 
armor.  You may want to use this to replace your default armor, as it offers 
superior shields and tech/biotic protection.

    +2 Paragon - "Are you okay?"
    +2 Paragon - "Don't blame yourself."
    +2 Renegade - "You abandoned them."
    +2 Renegade - "Fine, come with us."

4 - Investigate the Dig Site
At the bottom of the hill there are four more troopers guarding the dig site.  
Geth troopers have the ability to erect shields to provide cover for 
themselves, but have little other protection.  They are extremely vulnerable 
when their shields are disabled.  When you reach the dig site it is apparent 
that the beacon has been moved.  Ashley suggests that you check out the 
nearby research camp, which will now be marked on your map.  Loot the crate 
near the dig site, and then proceed up the hill to the north.

5 - The Camp
As you reach the top of the hill you discover that the giant spikes are 
designed to turn humans into synthetic zombie-like creatures called husks.  
These enemies have no ranged weapons, so they will charge at you instead.  
When they get close enough they will unleash a powerful electric explosion 
designed to take down your shields.  Keep your distance and make use of 
Kaidan's biotic powers, as the husks can withstand a surprising amount of 
damage from your weapons.  Don't miss the upgrade kit located behind the 
spikes.  There are two temporary structures at the camp.  The one on the left 
is unlocked and contains two crates, one of which provides you with some 
grenades and omni-gel.  The structure on the right is locked, but can be 
opened with sufficient decryption skill.  Two survivors, Dr. Warren and Dr. 
Manuel are hiding inside.  Dr. Warren can tell you about the attack, and she 
informs you that the beacon has been relocated to the spaceport.  If you 
inquire about Dr. Manuel's unusual behavior you will have the option to shut 
him up for a while.

    +2 Paragon - "You're safe."
    +9 Renegade - "I can shut him up!"

~~~~~~~~~~
DECRYPTION AND ELECTRONICS MINIGAME

The decryption minigame can be performed to unlock certain containers or to 
recover certain valuables from downed spacecraft or satellites.  Locked 
containers and doors can have three levels of difficulty (easy, average, and 
hard) and you--or a squad member--will need a certain number of points in the 
corresponding skill in order to attempt to open each type of lock: 1 point is 
required for easy, 5 points for average, and 9 points for hard.  Locks can 
also be opened by supplying the requisite amount of omni-gel, but only if you 
have sufficient skill.

Opening a lock on the Xbox 360 involves pressing one of the face buttons (A, 
B, X, or Y) soon after it glows on-screen.  The number of buttons that must 
be pressed depends (in theory) on the difficulty of the decryption.

On the PC the minigame is different, and requires you to navigate a cursor on 
a circular wheel to reach the center.  This is much like Frogger with several 
concentric circles you must traverse.  Navigate past the orange blocks (which 
are stationary) and the red blocks (which move) to reach the center.  Harder 
locks will increase the number of obstacles you must maneuver around.  You 
get to try again if you fail, but only if you have sufficient omni-gel.
~~~~~~~~~~

6 - The Rogue Spectre
Proceed up the hill to the north.  Ahead at the train station Nihlus turns a 
corner to see his friend Saren, a fellow Spectre.  Off in the distance you 
hear a single gunshot.  As you reach the crest of the hill, you can see a 
massive spaceship taking off from the spaceport ahead.  Take up defensive 
positions near the top of the hill and eliminate the husks and geth troopers 
below you.  You can shoot the explosive containers near the steps to 
eliminate the troopers quickly.  After the fight you can find a 
malfunctioning object in an alcove to the northwest that will give you some 
grenades and omni-gel.

7 - The Farmers (Optional)
A path to the east leads to another small temporary structure with a crate 
nearby.  After unlocking the door (easy decryption), three farmers emerge.  
They will tell you about the ship you saw, and admit their involvement in a 
smuggling operation that has been going on at the colony.  The farmers have 
been holding weapons and supplies for a smuggler at the spaceport.  They 
offer you an extra pistol--the Stinger II, which is an excellent early pistol 
and the only one of its kind that can be found in the game--which they have 
been holding for the smuggler.  If you have spent enough points in your Charm 
or Intimidate skills then you can get an extra upgrade item in addition to 
the pistol.  If you do so, Ashley will demand to know the name of the 
smuggler, and you can persuade them to reveal his identity.  Don't miss the 
storage locker (which has an easy electronics lock) inside the shed after the 
conversation concludes.

    +2 Paragon - "It's safe."
    +2 Renegade - "You're holding out on me." [1 Intimidate]
    +2 Paragon - "He may know something." [2 Charm]
    +2 Renegade - "Is he worth dying for?" [2 Intimidate]

8 - Powell the Smuggler
Ascending the steps to the train platform reveals Nihlus' fate.  A noise from 
behind the nearby crates turns out to be Powell, the smuggler the farmers 
informed you about.  He tells you about Saren's betrayal of Nihlus.  If 
confronted about his smuggling operation he will offer you some grenades to 
resupply you.  Using Charm or Intimidate you can get an additional grenade 
upgrade out of him.  There is a medical kit nearby, and an upgrade kit in the 
fires behind the crates.

    +2 Paragon - "Let it go, Williams."
    +2 Renegade - "You're lying." [3 Intimidate]

9 - Taking the Train
Continue north and take out the three nearby geth troopers.  You will need to 
board the train and fight your way to the other side to activate the controls 
that will take you to the spaceport.  The train itself is defended primarily 
by geth troopers, but there are also a couple geth destroyers to worry about.  
Destroyers are huge versions of the troopers, and will typically charge at 
you when they get close enough.  Keep your distance and concentrate on 
destroying them before moving forward.  Biotic powers are particularly useful 
for disabling heavy geth soldiers like the destroyer, as immobilizing them 
keeps them from using their powerful weapons against you.  There is a medical 
kit halfway up the train which will resupply your medi-gel.  Activate the 
train controls at the far end to proceed to the spaceport.  Meanwhile, Saren 
orders the geth to place explosives around the port to destroy the colony and 
cover up any evidence of their presence.

10 - Defusing the Situation
When you arrive at the spaceport your goal is to disarm all the demolition 
charges before time runs out.  The first charge is to your immediate left 
after exiting the train.  Simply press A (E on the PC) to defuse an explosive 
while your squad is covering you.  Go up the ramp.  The other charges show up 
on your radar, so you should have no trouble locating them.  Cross the nearby 
bridge and work your way north as you defuse the explosives.  You will need 
to worry about several geth troopers and geth shock troopers as you advance.  
Shock troopers are more heavily armed and armored than their trooper 
counterparts.  They too can erect kinetic barriers, and they have a missile 
attack similar to the destroyers.  If you are having trouble, consider 
leaving your team on the west side and heading back to the east side of the 
port to flank the geth.  There is a crate to the far north on the west side 
of the bridge.

11 - Secure the Beacon
Proceed west through the opening.  Descend the ramp and finish off the last 
of the troopers and husks.  There are two storage lockers to the south, a 
technician kit to the north, and a crate near the beacon itself.  You can 
approach the railing to the west for a view of the devastation left by the 
ship you saw.  Once you have secured the Prothean beacon you can radio the 
Normandy to come pick it up.  If you are playing as a male, Ashley will 
inadvertently activate the beacon.  As a female, Kaidan will activate the 
beacon.  You are forced to intervene, and the beacon downloads a violent 
vision into your brain before it finally explodes.

12 - On Approach to the Citadel
You wake up in the Normandy's medical bay.  Dr. Chakwas and Captain Anderson 
will explain the situation.  When the conversation concludes, you are 
instructed to head upstairs to the command deck and tell Joker to bring the 
Normandy into dock on the Citadel.

    Mission Complete: "Prologue: Find the Beacon"

~~~~~~~~~~
THE NORMANDY

Now is a good opportunity to explore and familiarize yourself with the SSV 
Normandy and her crew, as you now have unrestricted access to all levels of 
the ship.  You begin on the quarters deck.  There is an aid station in the 
medical bay where you can replenish your supply of medi-gel.  Outside is your 
locker, where supplies are frequently stored for you to pick up.  Sleeping 
pods are towards the bow, and the Captain's office is on the port side.

If you take the elevator down to the engineering level you can explore the 
engine room and the vehicle bay.  You can use the equipment lockers in the 
vehicle bay to stock your squad members with weapons and items.  You can also 
buy and sell equipment with the alliance requisition officer.
~~~~~~~~~~


<a id="21a3th">SECTION 3 - The Citadel                                               </a>


1 - Arrival on the Presidium
You arrive on the Citadel with Captain Anderson to meet with Ambassador 
Donnel Udina.  The ambassador is making a plea to the Citadel Council to have 
Saren disbarred from the Spectres for his involvement in the attack on Eden 
Prime.  The next step is to head to the Citadel tower and make a formal 
appeal at the hearing regarding Citadel Security's findings in the case 
against Saren.

    +2 Renegade - "They're blind."
    New Mission: "Citadel: Expose Saren"

~~~~~~~~~~
THE PRESIDIUM

You have arrived on the Presidium, one of two major areas--along with the 
Wards--that you can visit while on the Citadel.  The Presidium is split down 
the middle by a large lake with a few bridges running across it.  On the 
north side, from west to east, is the entrance to the Citadel tower, access 
to the Wards, and the embassies where you begin.  On the south side are the 
financial district and the Consort's chambers.

The Avina Tourism Terminals can give you more information about the 
Presidium, and there are signs posted to assist in navigation.  There are 
also several rapid transit terminals located around the Citadel.  Each 
terminal can transfer you directly to another location, provided you have 
either heard of--or been to--that location previously.

At first you are restricted to the Presidium level of the Citadel, and you 
will not be able to venture down into the Wards until you have spoken with 
the Council.  However, you can still begin several optional assignments in 
this area.  Terminals can be hacked in Ambassador Udina's office and in 
Executor Pallin's office on the other side of the lobby that offer 
information on assignments you will be able to complete later.  You can also 
head across the bridge from the embassies and visit the asari Consort who has 
a special task for you.
~~~~~~~~~~

2 - The Citadel Tower
Exit the ambassador's office through the door and descend the steps to the 
lobby.  Leave the embassies and proceed west towards the Citadel tower.  Take 
the elevator up to the top of the tower where the council chambers are 
located.  As you head south you witness an argument between Garrus Vakarian--
the turian C-Sec (Citadel Security Services) officer in charge of the 
investigation into Saren--and Executor Pallin, the head of C-Sec.  Garrus 
informs you that he was unable to find anything concrete linking Saren to the 
geth, but he plans to continue his investigation until he does.  Continue up 
the steps to the south and speak with Captain Anderson to join the hearing, 
which is already in progress.

3 - A Lack of Evidence
The Council decides that there is insufficient proof of Saren's connection to 
the geth or Eden Prime to disbar him from the Spectres.  In order to convince 
the Council otherwise you will need to find conclusive proof of Saren's 
involvement in the attack.  Kaidan will suggest that you speak with Garrus 
Vakarian, the C-Sec officer you met earlier.  Udina says you might be able to 
find him through Harkin, a retired human C-Sec officer.  Alternatively, if 
you ask Anderson about other sources of information he will suggest you try 
to contact the Shadow Broker, a galactic information dealer who may know 
something about Saren's activities.  One of his contacts on the Citadel is 
Barla Von, a wealthy financial advisor in the Presidium's financial district.

    +2 Paragon - "Quit protecting him!"
    New Mission: "Citadel: Garrus"
    New Mission: "Citadel: Shadow Broker"

3 - Talk to Barla Von (Optional)
If you choose to follow the lead concerning the Shadow Broker, you can find 
Barla Von's office in the southwest corner of the Presidium, just across the 
bridge from the Citadel tower elevator.  He informs you that Saren has 
recently betrayed the Shadow Broker, who is now more than willing to assist 
you in taking Saren down.  Barla Von advises you to seek out a Krogan bounty 
hunter named Wrex who may be able to help you.  Wrex was last seen at the C-
Sec Academy.

    "Citadel: Shadow Broker" -> "Citadel: Wrex"

~~~~~~~~~~
THE WARDS

The next major area of the Citadel is the Wards, which are a level below the 
Presidium and can be accessed by elevator following your meeting with the 
Council.  The Wards are home to clubs, gambling, markets, and some 
spectacular views of the Citadel's exterior and the Serpent Nebula.  There 
are two levels to the Wards, designated upper and lower.  There are markets 
on both levels to the west, with the popular clubs Flux and Chora's Den 
nearby.  A medical clinic resides on the upper level to the east. 
 
The Wards and the Presidium both grant access via elevator to the C-Sec 
Academy which in turn has an elevator that can take you to the docking bay 
where the Normandy is moored.
~~~~~~~~~~

4 - Talk to Harkin (Optional)
If you follow the lead concerning Garrus' whereabouts, you can find Harkin at 
Chora's Den, a shady club near the back alleys in the Wards.  You can get 
there quickly by accessing any of the rapid transit terminals.  Outside you 
are ambushed by some turian assassins working for Saren.  On the higher 
difficulty levels these can be some of the toughest enemies you will face 
early in the game.  Use the walkways for cover, keeping your squad in one 
place so you can flank the assassins.  Biotics can also be useful for pushing 
them off the balcony.  Once inside the club you can find Harkin sitting at a 
table on the opposite side from the entrance.  He will tell you that Garrus 
was last seen snooping around the med clinic on the other side of the Wards.

5 - Shootout in the Med Clinic (Optional)
Continuing the search for Garrus, head to the med clinic, located on the east 
side of the Upper Wards.  Inside you witness some thugs pressing the doctor 
for information.  They see you and a fight breaks out.  A well placed shot 
from Garrus ensures that the doctor is unharmed.  Take out the remaining 
thugs yourself, then speak to Garrus to find out what to do next.  Dr. Michel 
informs you that a quarian had recently passed though her clinic carrying 
evidence of Saren's connection to the geth.  She wanted to barter the 
information in return for her safety, so Michel put her in contact with Fist, 
the owner of Chora's Den and an employee of the Shadow Broker.  
Unfortunately, Fist betrayed the Shadow Broker and is now believed to be 
holding the quarian for Saren.  You need the quarian's information in order 
to implicate Saren, so it's off to Chora's den to take care of Fist.  The med 
clinic has an aid station you can use to replenish your medi-gel before you 
leave.

    +2 Paragon - "It was a big risk."
    +2 Renegade - "Nice shot."
    Mission Complete: "Citadel: Garrus"

6 - Pick up Wrex (Optional)
Travel to the C-Sec Academy--accessible by elevator from either the Presidium 
or the Wards--and head west.  Near the stairs to the C-Sec offices, Wrex is 
having a confrontation with some officers.  When their encounter is over you 
have the opportunity to offer Wrex a position on your squad.  Bear in mind 
that Wrex has been hired by the Shadow Broker to kill Fist, and he intends to 
fulfill his contract.  You are not required to invite Wrex to join your squad 
at any point if you already have Garrus on your team.  Similarly, if you pick 
up Wrex before going to get Garrus, he will tell you everything about the 
quarian, in which case you don't ever need to invite Garrus to join your 
squad.

    Mission Complete: "Citadel: Wrex"

~~~~~~~~~~
SQUAD SELECTION

After picking up Garrus or Wrex you have your first opportunity to select 
your squad.  You are only able to have two squad members with you at a time, 
so be sure to choose wisely.  You can only change who is in your squad by 
returning to the Normandy or when a new character is added to your team.

Consider what opposition you expect to face while using a given squad 
configuration.  For example, Kaidan provides a more balanced compliment to 
your squad, whereas Ashley is more combat focused.

Characters with tech abilities are useful against synthetic foes like the 
geth, and also typically have the ability to unlock secured containers and 
doors.  Biotic characters are good for disabling opponents and are useful 
when fighting large groups of enemies.
~~~~~~~~~~

7 - Assault on Chora's Den
Take your squad back to Chora's Den.  When you arrive the club is sealed up 
because Fist knows you are coming for him.  In addition to the bartender 
there are seven thugs inside, so stick to cover by the doors and take out one 
enemy at a time.  The big concern here is the krogan bouncer on the opposite 
side of the room, as he has the ability to regenerate health.  After you 
defeat all the guards, proceed into the back room for a confrontation with 
two warehouse workers.  You can kill them, or use your Charm or Intimidate 
skill to get them to surrender.  There is a weapon locker beyond the workers 
on the left side of the room.

    +2 Paragon - "Save yourselves." [3 Charm]
    +2 Renegade - "You're making a mistake." [3 Intimidate]

8 - Taking Care of Fist
In the final room you will encounter Fist himself, though the primary threats 
to you will be the two defensive turrets in each corner.  Garrus or Kaidan 
are useful here because of their tech skills, though Wrex evens the odds with 
his superior combat abilities.  Concentrate on one turret at a time and stick 
to cover as much as possible.  Biotics are ineffective against the turrets, 
so save these powers for Fist himself.  Destroying both turrets will cause 
Fist to surrender, at which time he will tell you where you can find the 
quarian.  If Wrex is in your party he will kill Fist to fulfill his contract 
with the Shadow Broker.  Otherwise you have the option to kill him yourself.  
There is a wall safe in the back corner of the room when you are finished.

    +2 Renegade - "You don't deserve to live."
    +2 Renegade - "He deserved it."

9 - Rescue the Quarian
The quarian is about to be set up by Fist's men.  You have a limited time to 
reach her and get the information you need.  As you exit Fist's offices you 
are confronted by six more thugs in the main lounge.  Deal with them quickly 
and proceed back towards the Wards.  Bear left when you exit and go through 
the back alleys to reach the quarian.  If you arrive in time you will have to 
fight a group of turian and salarian assassins to rescue her.  The salarians 
have some tech powers you need to worry about, so be cautious.  When the 
fight is over you can take the quarian's evidence against Saren to Ambassador 
Udina.

10 - The Quarian's Evidence
Back at the ambassador's office, the quarian--known as Tali'Zorah nar Rayya--
presents her evidence: She has a recording of Saren and an unidentified woman 
discussing the attack on Eden Prime.  Now that you have proof of Saren's 
involvement it is time to present your case to the Citadel Council.  Tali 
becomes a squad member and agrees to help you track down Saren.

11 - The Council's Decision
Return to the Citadel tower and present your findings to the Council.  Faced 
with undeniable proof of Saren's involvement with the geth, the Council 
disbars Saren from the Spectres.  The asari Councilor is able to identify the 
other voice from Tali's recording as that of Matriarch Benezia, an 
influential asari who is now a powerful ally for Saren and the geth.  Not 
wishing to send a fleet into the Attican Traverse and risk open war with the 
Terminus Systems, the Council elects to make you the first human Spectre, 
tasked with tracking down and stopping Saren at all costs.

    +2 Paragon - "It's the best solution."
    +2 Renegade - "Quit holding us back!"
    Spectre Training unlocked
    Bonus to Charm and Intimidate

12 - Speak to Anderson and Udina
When you have wrapped up any outstanding business on the Citadel, head to the 
docking bay by way of the C-Sec Academy and speak with Anderson and the 
ambassador.  They provide you with the locations of two possible leads on 
Saren's whereabouts: Geth have recently attacked a human colony on Feros, and 
the geth have also been sighted near Noveria.  It may also be worth tracking 
down Matriarch Benezia's daughter, Dr. Liara T'Soni, who is believed to be 
studying Prothean ruins somewhere in the Artemis Tau Cluster.  Now that you 
are a Spectre, you no longer answer to the Alliance military, and you may 
tackle these leads in any way you see fit.

    +2 Paragon - "I'll be careful."
    +2 Renegade - "That's your job."
    New Mission: "Find Liara T'Soni"
    New Mission: "Feros: Geth Attack"
    New Mission: "Noveria: Geth Interest"

13 - Prepare to Depart
Board the Normandy.  You have the opportunity to make a speech to your crew 
informing them of the mission and your determination to complete it.  
Afterwards, head to the galaxy map to set a new course. 


    +2 Paragon - "Humanity must do its part."
    +2 Renegade - "Nobody's going to help us."
    +2 Paragon - "Everyone is counting on us."
    +2 Renegade - "Humanity's in this alone!"

~~~~~~~~~~
CREW LOCATIONS

Now is a good opportunity to become acclimated to your ship and to identify 
where certain NPCs and squad members can be found. 
 
Ashley is in the vehicle bay near the crew lockers.  Kaidan is in the crew 
quarters near the captain's office.  Wrex is in the vehicle bay near the 
elevator and opposite the requisition officer.  Garrus is in the vehicle bay 
near the Mako.  Tali is in the engineering section. 
 
You can talk to each of your squad members between missions.  Doing so can 
open up new assignments, or allow you to pursue romantic relationships.
~~~~~~~~~~

14 - Non-humans on the Ship (Optional)
If you speak with Navigator Pressly, he will express his concerns about 
having aliens on the Normandy.  Talking to Ashley reveals that she has 
similar reservations.  You can try to change their minds about non-humans, or 
chide them for questioning your authority.

    +2 Paragon - "They're on our side."
    +2 Renegade - "You doubt my decisions?"

15 - Normandy Inspection (Optional)
The first time you return to the Citadel after becoming a Spectre you will be 
greeted in the docking bay by Rear Admiral Mikhailovich, commander of the 
63rd Scout Flotilla.  He intends to inspect your vessel.  You may refuse, but 
you can earn experience points and other rewards if you allow an inspection.

    +2 Paragon - "We need to build bridges." [9 Charm]
    +2 Renegade - "We need to kick ass." [9 Intimidate]
    +2 Renegade - "Damn right I did."


<a id="21a4li">SECTION 4 - Liara's Dig Site                                          </a>


1 - The Artemis Tau Cluster
Your first lead involves finding the daughter of Matriarch Benezia, who is 
believed to be somewhere in the Artemis Tau Cluster.  Access the Galaxy Map 
on the Normandy and select the appropriate cluster, then zoom in to view the 
known systems.  Select the Knossos System to travel there.  When you arrive, 
move your cursor to the planet Therum and select it to land on the planet.

2 - To the Refinery
The path before you is fairly linear.  Take the Mako north and follow the 
path between the cliffs and the lava.  Make your way around towards the 
south, at which point a geth dropship will deposit a pair of geth armatures 
in your path.  Keep your distance and use your jump jets to avoid their 
attacks.  There is a refinery to the east but the way is blocked by a large 
gate and three geth heavy turrets.  Take the detour around to the north, 
which is guarded by only one heavy turret.  This path leads to the heart of 
the refinery, which is guarded by regular geth troopers and shock troopers, 
but also by rocket troopers, which have weak personal defenses but a powerful 
ranged attack.  Your toughest opponent is a geth juggernaut, which is a more 
powerful version of the destroyer you faced on Eden Prime.  Stay in the Mako 
and keep your distance while avoiding enemy rockets.  Search the refinery 
thoroughly, as there are a number of storage containers you can plunder.  The 
controls to lower the north gate are located in the building to the 
northwest.

3 - Proceed in the Mako
Continue north, where you will encounter several more armatures.  There are 
rocket troopers and a geth colossus guarding the entrance to the tunnel you 
must use to precede.  Once again, keep your distance and zoom in with your 
turret to make dealing with these enemies easier.  There are a small group of 
rocket troopers on the other side of the tunnel.  Continue on until you reach 
another tunnel.  You will encounter some rocket troopers inside the tunnel 
this time, along with more geth troopers and rocket troopers at the exit.

4 - On Foot to the Dig Site
You eventually reach a point where the path narrows and you must leave the 
Mako and continue on foot.  Your radar will be jammed by a nearby sniper.  
Proceed east up the hill until you encounter geth troopers and rocket 
troopers.  Stay in cover and pick your shots to avoid the missiles from the 
rocket troopers.  There are also shock troopers and a geth sniper waiting in 
the clearing up ahead, so be on your guard.

5 - The Mining Camp
At the mining camp you are ambushed by a group of geth stalkers and a geth 
armature.  Take cover, keep your distance, and take care of the stalkers 
first.  Having squad members with tech abilities can help to deal with the 
regular geth enemies.  There is also some cover on a small hill to the east 
that is perfect for taking down the armature from a distance.  Spend as 
little time out of cover as possible, and avoid the blast from its pulse 
cannon at all costs.  Once all the geth are defeated you may proceed inside 
the mine itself.

6 - Exploring the Mine
Follow the ramps down into the mine.  You will encounter some shock troopers 
and snipers along the way.  Take the elevator down to the next level and 
follow the catwalks.  As you approach the next elevator a group of geth 
assault drones will appear from below.  Like the recon drones, they are 
resistant to biotics but susceptible to tech powers.  Take the second 
elevator.  At the bottom, climb down the debris pile and approach the asari 
behind the blue barrier.

7 - Freeing Dr. T'Soni
Liara T'Soni is trapped by a Prothean security device.  Before you can get 
her out however, you must find some way past the barrier.  Keep descending 
the ramps until you reach the bottom of the mine where you will find more 
shock troopers and snipers.  At the far end there is a storage locker and a 
weapon locker.  Return to the nearby mining laser and activate it using the 
correct sequence, A-X-B-Y (the code varies on the PC).  This opens a hole you 
can proceed through.  Activate the elevator at the end of the tunnel and take 
it up to Liara's location so you can free her.

8 - Escaping the Mine
It seems the mining laser has caused some seismic activity and you need to 
leave quickly.  Take the elevator up to the top floor, where you will 
encounter the krogan Liara warned you about.  You can't talk your way out of 
a fight, so you must defeat the krogan battlemaster along with his geth 
soldiers.  The geth will try to move around the sides of the room to attack 
your squad from all directions.  The krogan will also try to disable you with 
his biotics so he can charge and engage you from close range.  Turn the 
tables and use your own biotics to make this fight much easier.  When all the 
enemies are defeated it is a simple matter of racing to the surface to avoid 
certain death.

9 - Back on the Normandy
When you return to your ship the crew gathers for a debriefing.  Liara will 
discuss her work as a scientist studying Prothean ruins, as well as your 
visions from the Prothean beacon.  When the meeting is over you can choose 
whether to discuss the mission with the Citadel Council.

    Mission Complete: "Find Liara T'Soni"


<a id="21a5fe">SECTION 5 - Feros                                                     </a>


1 - Zhu's Hope
Land at the docking bay on Feros, where you are greeted by David al 
Talaquani.  He informs you that the leader of the colony--Fai Dan--wishes to 
speak with you, before being disintegrated by a geth rocket.  Fight though 
the enemies and head up the stairs to reach the Zhu's Hope colony.

~~~~~~~~~~
ZHU'S HOPE

Zhu's Hope is a small settlement, and is all that remains of the human colony 
on Feros.  It is built into one of the ancient Prothean skyscrapers that dot 
the Feros landscape, and is structured around the Borealis, a disabled 
modular conveyor. 
 
There are numerous colonists diligently working on their assigned tasks, 
while others man the barricades to keep out the geth.  Fai Dan can be found 
on the far side of the freighter.
~~~~~~~~~~

2 - "Geth in the Tower!"
You can find Fai Dan on the far side of the colony, but you don't get to 
speak to him for long.  More geth attack, and this time you need to follow 
them to the source and eliminate the threat they pose to the colonists.  When 
the initial wave is defeated, proceed up the stairs and continue bearing left 
until you reach the tower to the northwest.  This is where you will fight the 
bulk of the geth forces.  Find some cover and be on the lookout for the 
destroyer that appears from the far end.  When all the geth are defeated, the 
overhead dropship will depart, making the colonists a little safer for now.

3 - Return to Fai Dan
Go back the way you came and return to the colony, where you can finally have 
a talk with Fai Dan.  He tells you that the geth are operating out of the 
nearby ExoGeni research facility.  If asked, he also informs you of the 
various challenges facing the colonists, including a geth outpost in the 
tunnels, food and water shortages, and a lack of power.  He can direct you to 
the different colonists assigned to each task.  You aren't required to handle 
any of these assignments, so you can find the details on how to complete them 
in the Optional Assignments section.

    +2 Paragon - "Happy to help."
    +2 Renegade - "I didn't do it for you."

4 - Strange Behavior (Optional)
Head inside the nearby freighter and talk to Calantha and Hollis Blake.  The 
former is complaining of extreme headaches, but their cause is unknown.  
Talking to the other colonists reveals equally strange symptoms.  They all 
seem unusually focused on their assigned tasks, and pressing them for 
information seems to make them uncomfortable.  You can also venture down into 
the tunnels and find Ian Newstead, a man who seems to be in tremendous pain 
for an unknown reason.  You can ask Fai Dan about this behavior, but he 
dismisses it as the traumatic effect of seeing friends and loved ones killed.

    +2 Paragon - "What's wrong?"
    +2 Renegade - "I hope you're not contagious." 
    +2 Paragon - "Can I help?"
    +2 Renegade - "Kill him."

5 - Skyway to Hell
From the colony, ascend the stairs and bear right to reach the nearby 
elevator.  This takes you up to the garage, where the Mako is conveniently 
parked.  A geth drone is attacking the colonists in the garage, so destroy it 
and then jump in the Mako.  When you exit the garage a dropship swoops in and 
deposits a pair of armatures on the path ahead of you.  Take them out from a 
distance with the cannon before you proceed.

6 - Weigh Station Refugees (Optional)
As you drive along the skyway you begin picking up radio chatter which is 
coming from the weigh station up ahead.  When you reach the station you have 
the option of getting out and checking on the refugees, though you can also 
continue up the nearby ramp and ignore the camp for now.  The two prominent 
figures at the camp are Juliana Baynham and Ethan Jeong, the former of which 
is worried for her daughter, Lizbeth.  Lizbeth, she believes, is still at the 
ExoGeni facility, though Jeong is doubtful she would have survived the geth 
attack.  You can also speak to Gavin Hossle, who wants you to recover some 
data for him.  Be on the lookout for hidden maintenance tunnels as you travel 
the skyway, as they contain a few hidden geth and some containers you can 
loot.

7 - The ExoGeni Facility
Proceed along the skyway until you reach the ExoGeni main level where you 
must leave the Mako for now.  The path south is blocked by an energy field 
you will need to deactivate later.  The door to the north is locked, but 
leads to a small room with a malfunctioning object.  Be aware that accessing 
the object alerts the nearby geth armature to your presence.  To proceed, you 
must go southwest and drop down a small ledge to reach the lower level.  You 
will be unable to return this way, so you must deactivate the energy field in 
order to return to the Mako.

8 - Lizbeth
Elizabeth Baynham can be found on this level as soon as you exit the first 
corridor.  She informs you that the geth are likely here for the Thorian, an 
indigenous plant-like lifeform.  She also gives you her pass card, which 
allows you unrestricted access to the facility.  Immediately after the 
conversation concludes you are beset by a swarm of varren.  Shotguns work 
well here, as the varren don't have much protection and will simply charge at 
you.  Proceed to the other side of the room and take the stairs back up to 
the main level.

9 - The VI
At the top of the steps there is a krogan commander trying to obtain 
restricted information from a VI interface.  He becomes alerted to your 
presence and attacks.  Biotics work well for disabling him before he can 
charge at you.  Once he is defeated you can access the VI, which identifies 
you as Lizbeth because you are carrying her pass card.  From the VI you can 
learn that the Thorian is a sentient creature which produces spores that 
allow it to control the minds of other lifeforms.  The Thorian was the focus 
of ExoGeni's research of Feros, and the Zhu's Hope colonists were 
deliberately infected in order to study their behavior.

    "Feros: Geth Attack" -> "Feros: The Thorian"

10 - The Geth Church
Head east along the corridor.  The first room you come to shows that the 
power for the energy field is coming from a geth ship, which has anchored 
itself to the side of the facility.  To cut the power you will need to remove 
the ship by severing one of its claws.  There are a few geth shock troopers 
to fight, after which you can examine the strange glowing orb they seemed to 
be praying to.  Your squad will speculate as to its purpose.  Keep going 
until you reach the next room, which is on the opposite side of the energy 
field you first saw when you entered the facility.  This is the field you 
will need to remove to get back to the Mako.  The path to the east leads to 
the upper level of the facility, which has a small room guarded by a few 
krogan.  Inside there is a server node that supplies a codex entry, a secure 
storage locker, and the console containing Gavin Hossle's data.

11 - Anchors Aweigh
The path to the west also leads to the upper level.  In the first room is an 
ExoGeni terminal that gives the assignment "Investigate Facility."  Proceed 
up the stairs to the platform.  A quick peek at the next room shows that it 
is heavily guarded.  Stick to the stairs and the platform to avoid being 
overwhelmed by the geth.  When all the enemies are defeated you can access 
the secure crate in the next room, along with a terminal which gives the 
assignment "Geth Activities," and a server which gives the assignment 
"Investigate Samples."  Most importantly, at the back of the room are the 
shuttle bay door controls.  Here you want to hit the sweet spot by setting 
the internal pressure to be between 31 and 34 pounds per square inch.  You 
can do this by activating a number of smaller controls which each provide a 
fixed amount of pressure.  One combination that works is 17 + 11 + 5 = 33 psi 
(228 kPa).  Activating the door controls with this level of pressure will 
force the door to shear straight through the geth anchor, causing it to lose 
its grip on the building.  This severs the power, taking care of the energy 
barrier.

12 - Back to the Weigh Station
Retrace your steps and proceed north towards the Mako though the now 
accessible corridor.  Lizbeth is waiting for you at the exit, where you will 
confront her about her involvement with the Thorian.  Get back in the Mako 
and head back to the weigh station to reunite Lizbeth with her mother.  There 
are a handful of geth armatures and destroyers to contend with on the way 
back to the station.

    +2 Paragon - "I believe you,"
    +2 Renegade - "I don't care."

13 - The Situation with the Colonists
Lizbeth gets out at the weigh station and is reunited with her mother.  
Unfortunately, Jeong has reestablished communications with the ExoGeni 
corporate office and has learned that they want the entire colony purged to 
prevent the Thorian from spreading.  Using Charm or Intimidate you can talk 
Jeong out of it, but otherwise you simply have to kill him.  Before you head 
back to Zhu's Hope, Juliana presents an idea for stopping the infected 
colonists without having to kill them.  She offers you a grenade upgrade 
which contains a nerve agent that should safely pacify the colonists.  It is 
your choice whether or not to use the upgrade.

    +24 Paragon - "What about the big picture?" [12 Charm]
    +25 Renegade - "I'll kill you first." [10 Intimidate]
    +2 Paragon - "Sounds logical."
    +2 Renegade - "Can't take that chance." 
    +2 Paragon - "I'll do it." / "Sure."
    +2 Renegade - "No." / "Forget it."

14 - The Creepers
Head back to the Mako and return to the colony, where you will have your 
first encounter with a Thorian Creeper.  These creatures were created by the 
Thorian, so unlike the colonists there is no penalty for killing them.  There 
are a large number of them in the garage, which should get you acclimated to 
their fighting style.  They don't have any weapons, but they spew a toxic 
substance when they get close enough.  Shotguns with ammunition upgrades that 
knock down the Creepers will help keep them away from you.

15 - The Infected Colonists
At the entrance to the garage you have the option of ordering your squad to 
hold their fire on the colonists themselves.  Doing so means your allies will 
only attack the Creepers, leaving you free to handle the colonists.  If you 
wish to save them, equip the Anti-Thorian Gas upgrade to your grenades and 
use them to attack the colonists.  You can also melee them to knock them out 
without killing them.  This is riskier however, because if you misjudge the 
distance you might shoot them by mistake.  There are sixteen colonists in all 
that you can save.  The first group you encounter is at the top of the 
elevator in the garage.  You can then find a few colonists on the landing as 
you descend the steps to Zhu's Hope.  There are more at the entrance to the 
colony itself, where you can also find a crate that will replenish your 
supply of grenades.  Save or kill the remaining colonists on the western 
walkway and near the crane controls to complete this objective.  When all the 
colonists and Creepers are dealt with, activate the crane controls to reveal 
the stairway down to the Thorian's lair.  Fai Dan shows up, telling you that 
the Thorian wants him to kill you.  However, he is able to fight off the 
Thorian just enough to end his own life before you have to fight him.

    +2 Paragon for each colonist saved
    +2 Renegade for each colonist killed

16 - The Thorian
Take the steps down into the Thorian's lair.  As you approach the Thorian 
itself, it spews out an asari clone which speaks to you on its behalf.  It 
seems that Saren came to Feros and formed an alliance with the Thorian.  He 
bartered the lives of the colonists for the Thorian's ancient knowledge of 
the Protheans, but then betrayed the Thorian, sending the geth to destroy it 
and prevent you from receiving its secrets.

    +2 Paragon - "Let the colonists go."
    +2 Renegade - "I'll destroy you."

17 - Severing the Nodes
The asari clone attacks you.  Beware of her biotic abilities and kill her as 
quickly as possible.  Consider using biotics of your own to knock her off the 
edge, or equip ammunition upgrades that bypass shields to help deal with her 
biotic barrier.  To eliminate the Thorian itself you must sever each of the 
neural nodes holding it to the walls of the lair.  Your efforts will be 
hampered by legions of Thorian Creepers, and the occasional asari clone.  
Melee attacks work well in this area, as any enemy you knock off the edge 
will be killed.  On the first level go north through the door and sever the 
first node by firing on it until it explodes.  Usually, firing on a node will 
alert a number of dormant nearby Creepers, so take care to eliminate as many 
enemies as possible before you try to take down each node.  The nodes also go 
down faster when all nearby enemies are defeated.  Proceed up the steps to 
the next level where you can find another asari clone as well as a weapons 
locker before coming to the next neural node.  On the next level there is a 
node to the south, and another to the west as you proceed clockwise around 
the chamber.  Keep an eye out for the medical station on this level.  Head up 
to the next level and destroy the node to the northwest.  Finally, on the top 
level, head counterclockwise until you reach the final node on the south side 
of the lair.

18 - The Cipher
Destroying the final node causes the Thorian to lose its grip and fall into 
the abyss below.  An asari then emerges from one of the Thorian's pods along 
the wall.  She identifies herself as Shiala, a former follower of Matriarch 
Benezia who Saren had used to interface with the Thorian and learn about the 
Protheans.  She has turned her back on Saren and Benezia, and offers you the 
Cipher, the same knowledge she gave to Saren, in the hopes that you can stop 
him.  However, because she was once a servant of Saren, you have the option 
of killing her, and she offers no resistance if that is your decision.  If 
you let her live she vows to help rebuild the colony, as she wants to make 
amends for playing a role in their suffering.

    +8 Paragon - "A noble idea." / "Sounds good to me."
    +9 Renegade - "I can't let you live."

19 - Normandy Debrief
Back on the ship, your crew meets in the comm room to discuss the mission.  
If you have picked up Liara already, she will offer to join her mind with 
yours to try to make more sense of your visions.  When the briefing is over 
you can talk to the Council if you choose.

    +2 Paragon - "I help everyone." / "I wanted to help them."
    +2 Renegade - "Don't be stupid!"
    +2 Paragon - "I understood it."
    Mission Complete: "Feros: The Thorian"

20 - Citadel Check-in (Optional)
If you feel inclined, you can return to the human embassy on the Citadel to 
give a report on the Feros mission to Anderson and Udina.  As you might 
expect, Udina is very concerned with the repercussions of your actions.

    +2 Paragon - "That's all you care about?"

~~~~~~~~~~
VIRMIRE

After you complete two of the primary plot worlds (Therum, Feros, or 
Noveria), you will receive a message from the council advising you of a new 
lead into Saren's whereabouts.  They have lost contact with a salarian 
infiltration regiment investigating Saren's activates on the planet Virmire.  
Their last communication was an unintelligible transmission on an emergency 
frequency.

    +2 Paragon - "Good."
    +2 Renegade - "This is my investigation."
    New Mission: "Virmire"
    New Mission: "Race Against Time" 
 
Additionally, completing Feros unlocks the nearby Maroon Sea Cluster, which 
contains three systems you can visit and continues the story of ExoGeni and

1 - Confrontation in the Docking Bay
Head to Noveria and land at Port Hanshan.  Before you can leave the docking 
bay, you are confronted by a group of armed guards led by Maeko Matsuo, who 
identifies herself as an employee of Elanus Risk Control Services (ERCS) and 
the head of security at Port Hanshan.  They try to confiscate your weapons, 
but a voice on the intercom interrupts, telling Captain Matsuo to stand down 
and let you pass.

    +2 Paragon - "We'll cooperate."
    +2 Renegade - "I'm keeping my gun."

2 - Entering the Port
Continue through security.  Your weapons will set off an alarm, but it's 
nothing to worry about according to Gianna Parasini, the assistant to 
Administrator Anoleis.  She informs you that Matriarch Benezia passed through 
the port a few days ago on her way to the Peak 15 research facility.  In 
order to follow her you will need to procure a garage pass, for which you 
must see the administrator.  If Liara is in your squad she will ask if you 
still want her to join you.  If she is not currently with you, a squad member 
will suggest that you return to the ship to get her.

    New Mission: "Noveria: Leave Port Hanshan"
    "Noveria: Geth Interest" -> "Noveria: Matriarch Benezia"

3 - Port Security (Optional)
After speaking with Parasini, you can head back to speak with Captain Matsuo 
for a chance to improve (or worsen) your relationship with the local security 
forces.  While you can win Captain Matsuo over, Sergeant Kaira Stirling isn't 
so easy.

    +2 Paragon - "Forget about it."
    +2 Renegade - "Humiliating, wasn't it?"

4 - The Administrator
Anoleis' office is in the southeast corner of the port.  Head through the 
doors and speak to Miss Parasini, who will let you in to see the 
administrator.  Anoleis is a very impatient salarian, who will inform you 
that Saren is a major investor in Binary Helix, and that Benezia is here to 
address an issue at their research facility.  The only way he will provide 
you a pass to leave the port is if you inform him about Opold's request as 
part of the "Noveria: Smuggling" assignment.  Doing this provides you the 
quickest way out of the port but misses out on a fair amount of content and a 
hefty sum of Paragon and Renegade points.

5 - "You Can't Bludgeon Through Bureaucracy" (Optional)
Back outside Anoleis' office you must talk to Gianna again to learn that 
there are other ways of securing a garage pass.  She advises you to speak 
with Lorik Qui'in, who can be found at the nearby hotel.  Head to the 
northwest side of the port and take the elevator up to the hotel lobby.  
Lorik Qui'in is seated at a table on the left as you enter.  Qui'in tells you 
that Anoleis has closed his office because Qui'in has evidence of the 
administrator's corruption.  At this very moment, Anoleis' goons are 
ransacking the Synthetic Insights offices looking for the evidence.  Qui'in 
offers you a deal: Recover the evidence against Anoleis from his office, and 
he will provide you with the garage pass you need to leave the port.

    New Mission: "Noveria: Lorik Qui'in"

6 - Retrieving the Evidence (Optional)
Agree to Qui'in's deal to receive his elevator pass, allowing you to enter 
the Synthetic Insights offices.  Before you leave the hotel, you can head 
upstairs to the office in the southwest corner and access the terminal to get 
the assignment "Doctor at Risk."  You can also deactivate the Synthetic 
Insights security system from here by decrypting the security control unit.  
The offices can be accessed by an elevator located in the southwest corner of 
the port.  When you arrive, you will find ERCS guards scouring the place.  It 
is possible to persuade the first group you encounter to leave peacefully, 
but you will have to fight the rest in order to get to the evidence, which is 
located in the top floor office at the end of the walkway.

    +8 Paragon - "You're here illegally." [6 Charm]
    +9 Renegade - "You can't take us." [8 Intimidate]

7 - The Crooked Cop (Optional)
On your way out after retrieving the evidence you will be stopped by a group 
of guards led by Kaira Stirling, who you first met when you entered the port.  
She plans on taking revenge for the ERCS guards you killed to get Qui'in's 
evidence.  Watch out for Kaira's biotic abilities, as well as the snipers she 
has with her.  When all the guards are defeated, descend the elevator to 
leave the offices.

    +2 Paragon - "They didn't give me a choice."
    +2 Renegade - "Bring it on."

8 - Gianna's Proposal (Optional)
At the bottom of the elevator you encounter Gianna Parasini again, who asks 
that you meet her at the hotel before you talk to Lorik Qui'in about the 
evidence.  Go there and speak with her to learn that she is actually an 
undercover internal affairs agent investigating Anoleis.  It seems the 
executive board for Noveria is well aware of Anoleis' corruption, and has 
been trying to get enough evidence to prosecute him.  Now that you have that 
evidence, she wants you to convince Qui'in to testify against Anoleis.  
Combined with the evidence from his office, Lorik's testimony should be 
sufficient enough to warrant Anoleis' arrest.  She promises to get you the 
garage pass you need if you agree to help her out.  If prompted, she can also 
give you some information on what has been going on at the Peak 15 facility.

    New Mission: "Noveria: Peak 15"

~~~~~~~~~~
THE EVIDENCE

You now must decide what to do with the evidence against Anoleis.  If you 
deliver the evidence to Qui'in, he will give you the garage pass along with a 
small reward.  You can convince him to testify against Anoleis, in which case 
you keep the evidence but receive neither the credits nor the garage pass.

    +500 Credits - "Agreed." / "If that's all you have."
    +750 Credits - "Anoleis would pay more." [7 Intimidate]
    +750 Credits - "You owe me." [8 Charm]
    +24 Paragon - "You'd be a hero." [5 Charm]
    +25 Renegade - "Damn right I will." [5 Intimidate]

You can also take the evidence to Anoleis, who will offer you a garage pass 
and a large sum of credits in exchange.  However, with a sufficient Charm or 
Intimidate skill you can blackmail Anoleis, receiving the garage pass but 
keeping the evidence.  If you alert Anoleis that Gianna is an undercover 
agent, then he will call her into his office and they will both be killed in 
the ensuing shootout.  You can then grab the garage pass from Anoleis' 
corpse.
 
    +9 Renegade - "I accept."
    +0 Paragon - "I'm not here to arrest you." [4 Charm]
    +0 Renegade - "You'll do what I say." [8 Intimidate]
    +25 Renegade - "Gianna is investigating you."

Gianna will only be able to use the evidence if you first convinced Qui'in to 
testify.  If you did, then she will give you the garage pass in exchange and 
make the arrest.

    +8 Paragon - "I convinced Qui'in."
    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Leave Port Hanshan"
    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Lorik Qui'in"

In the scenario where both Anoleis and Gianna are dead, Qui'in will pay you 
half the promised amount, but only with some persuasion.

    +250 Credits - "We made a deal." [6 Charm]
    +250 Credits - "That's where you're wrong." [4 Intimidate]
~~~~~~~~~~

9 - Change of Administration (Optional)
If you had Anoleis arrested, you can return to the docking bay and discuss 
the matter with Captain Matsuo.

    +2 Paragon - "He was a criminal."
    +2 Renegade - "Your opinion doesn't matter."

10 - Accessing the Garage
Take your garage pass and access the garage in the southwest area of the 
port.  You won't get far however, as a group of geth led by a pair of 
destroyers ambush you before you can reach the Mako.  You can make this fight 
easier by decrypting the lock on the nearby crawler and turning its guns 
against the geth.  Once the fight is over, Matsuo shows up to investigate the 
commotion.  The geth were clearly smuggled though security in the cargo 
crates, meaning there could be dozens of geth on the road to Peak 15.

~~~~~~~~~~
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Most combat armor is not designed for the harsh conditions on Noveria's 
surface: If you leave the safety of the Mako, you will freeze to death very 
quickly.

However, armor manufactured by Devlon Industries (namely the Survivor, 
Explorer, Liberator, and Thermal Armor types) will provide complete 
protection from level 1 environmental hazards like those on Noveria.  They 
will also give you limited protection on worlds with level 2 hazards.
~~~~~~~~~~

11 - Hit the Road
Grab the nearby upgrade kit and then hop in the Mako.  Keep an eye out for 
crates and kits along the route to Peak 15, especially near abandoned 
vehicles.  The path is crawling with rocket troopers, along with some heavy 
turrets and armatures.  Be especially wary of the tunnels, which act as choke 
points, making it harder to dodge incoming rockets.  Keep your distance from 
enemies and back off if you start taking too much fire.

12 - Peak 15
When you reach the facility, hop out and head inside, where a number of geth 
are waiting for you.  The biggest danger is a geth juggernaut, who will 
charge you when you open the door.  Hang back to avoid being flanked by the 
krogan on the balcony to the left, and concentrate on taking down the 
juggernaut first.  There are also a few krogan at the far end of the room.  
When all the enemies are defeated, head up the ramp to the nearby security 
office, which has an upgrade kit and storage locker.  Opposite the security 
office is the elevator up to the administration level.

13 - Cafeteria Surprise
Cautiously enter the cafeteria.  As soon as you eliminate the geth guards, a 
swarm of rachni will appear.  Previously thought to be extinct, it seems the 
Peak 15 researchers have found a way bring back the rachni, though it is 
apparent that things have gone horribly wrong.  There are two types of rachni 
to worry about in the facility: The workers are small, and their only attack 
it to rush at you and explode when they get close enough.  Soldiers, on the 
other hand, can spit acid from afar, but also have a deadly melee attack.  
Both enemy types cause toxic damage, so upgrades that mitigate this effect 
will help you progress through the facility.  You should also remain alert 
while exploring, as the soldiers often spring out of vents in the floor.  
When all the rachni in this area are dead, take the elevator to the Mira 
Core.

14 - Restoring the VI
To get to the next area of the facility you need to take the tram, but first 
you have to restore a number of critical systems that have gone offline 
because of the rachni outbreak.  You must first reactivate Peak 15's VI to 
assist you in the restoration of each system.  Activate the power junction in 
the main room and then head to the center of the round room ahead.  Enter the 
elevator in the middle to descend into the core.  Here, to restore the VI you 
can either spend 100 omni-gel, or solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle.  
When you finish, the VI system is restored and you can now begin restoring 
the other systems.

    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Peak 15"
    New Mission: "Noveria: Reconnect Landlines"
    New Mission: "Noveria: Reactor Repair"

~~~~~~~~~~
MIRA CORE PUZZLE

To restore the VI manually, you need to move each of the four blocks in the 
first column (labeled X on the Xbox 360) to another column (either Y or B), 
with the provision that only the top block in each column can be moved.  
Press the button corresponding with the column you want to move a block from, 
and then the button corresponding to the column you want to move that block 
to in order to rearrange the puzzle pieces.

There are multiple ways to solve this puzzle, but here is a common solution:  
Begin by moving the top three blocks to the middle column.  This frees up the 
bottom block to be moved to the right column, where the top three blocks can 
then be stacked on top of it.  Follow these instructions to achieve this 
result:

X -> Y    1 -> 2
X -> B    1 -> 3 
Y -> B    2 -> 3 
X -> Y    1 -> 2
B -> X    3 -> 1
B -> Y    3 -> 2
X -> Y    1 -> 2
X -> B    1 -> 3
Y -> B    2 -> 3
Y -> X    2 -> 1
B -> X    3 -> 1
Y -> B    2 -> 3
X -> Y    1 -> 2
X -> B    1 -> 3
Y -> B    2 -> 3
~~~~~~~~~~

15 - Reconnect the Landlines
The Mira VI appears and informs you that a number of critical systems are 
offline and need to be repaired before you can proceed.  First up are the 
landlines on the roof, which need to be reconnected.  Head west and take the 
elevator to the roof, where you must fight through a horde of rachni.  When 
all the creatures are dead, simply reconnect the landlines and head back down 
to the Mira Core.

    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Reconnect Landlines"

16 - Repair the Fuel Lines
Go east, and then north along the corridor to the elevator that leads to the 
reactor.  Here you must face a variety of geth soldiers.  Take the passage on 
the left side, and follow it around to the ramp.  You will want to clear out 
the top floor and balcony first to make getting to the fuel lines safer.  
Though there are destroyers and stalkers on the lower walkways, there is a 
juggernaut in the balcony you need to be aware of.  Once all the geth are 
eliminated, follow the lower walkways around to the middle of the reactor and 
activate the fuel line controls.  When you are finished, head back to the 
Mira Core.

    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Reactor Repair"
    New Mission: "Noveria: Contamination"

17 - Taking the Tram
With the landlines and fuel lines fixed, the way south is now open, taking 
you to the tram platform.  To get there you first need to clear out the 
decontamination chamber, which has some rachni soldiers trapped in it.  With 
a high enough electronics skill you can repair the decon system and torch the 
rachni remotely.  Otherwise, decrypt the lock or have Mira open the door for 
you and eliminate the rachni yourself.  The way is now clear to the tram 
platform.  Hop on the tram and take it to Rift Station.

    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Contamination"

18 - Rift Station
Exit the tram and head north.  The northern door is locked, and the path to 
the east leads to a pair of elevators, only one of which you can access.  
Take the elevator up to the main level and speak with Captain Ventralis, who 
is leading the defense against the rachni.  With sufficient Charm or 
Intimidate you can get him to reveal more about the station's defenses.  As 
soon as your conversation ends, a group of rachni soldiers attack the 
barricade.  You can help fight them off, or run away.  Afterwards, Ventralis 
will tell you that Benezia is down in the hot labs and give you a pass card 
for the elevator.

    +2 Paragon - "I'll see what I can do."
    +2 Renegade - "I'm not here to help."
    +2 Paragon - "No problem."
    +2 Renegade - "You're welcome." / "You couldn't handle it?"
    New Mission: "Noveria: The Hot Labs"

~~~~~~~~~~
RIFT STATION

Captain Ventralis wants you to go down to the hot labs, and while you can do 
so now, you can also save this task for later.  The primary objective is to 
reach Benezia, who--contrary to Ventralis's information--is actually in the 
secure labs in the center of the lower level.  There are several ways to get 
there.
 
The first choice is to simply blast your way through the security on the main 
level and then take the elevator down to the lower level.  To do this you 
would have to decrypt the door lock and breach the defenses that have been 
set up to stop the rachni.  Taking this route turns all the soldiers in the 
complex against you. 
 
The alternative is to sneak in through the maintenance tunnels by way of the 
scientist barracks on the lower level.  To do this, you will need help from 
Dr. Cohen, as detailed below. 
 
Note that you can also reach Benezia by investigating the hot labs first.  
Doing so opens up both the security entrance and the maintenance passage once 
you return from the hot labs.
~~~~~~~~~~

19 - Direct Assault (Optional)
To get to Benezia as fast as possible, simply breach the security door on the 
north side of the mess hall on the main level.  The two nearby sentry drones 
will attack you, as will the guards beyond the door.

20 - Dr. Cohen (Optional)
Alternatively--if you want to avoid a fight--you will need to gain access to 
the maintenance tunnels.  Doing so will allow you to sneak into the secure 
labs without alerting the guards.  On the main level, go down the winding 
stairs to the west to find Dr. Cohen.  He needs your help making a cure for 
his fellow researchers who have been exposed to a toxin they were developing.  
You can use Charm or Intimidate for more information on what has been going 
on at Peak 15.

    New Mission: "Noveria: Quarantine"

21 - Getting the Cure (Optional)
Go back to Captain Ventralis and get his permission to enter the quarantined 
lab.  You can find the lab on the lower level to the south guarded by an ERCS 
guard.  Go inside and make the cure by pressing the appropriate buttons so 
that the meter falls between the first indicator and the second.  When the 
cure is complete you are interrupted by Alestia Iallis, a servant of 
Matriarch Benezia who has decided this is the perfect time to ambush you.  
She has a couple geth troopers with her, so take cover and try to avoid her 
biotics.  Because of the close quarters, powers like Singularity work 
especially well here.  When the battle is finished, return to Cohen and give 
him the cure, receiving the maintenance tunnel pass in return.  You can also 
use Charm or Intimidate to get some extra supplies from him.  Access the 
maintenance tunnel on the lower level to reach the secure labs.  Note that 
from here you can take the elevator up to the secured area on the main level, 
but if you step off the elevator everyone will become hostile as if you had 
breached the security via the direct assault described previously.

    +24 Paragon - Give Dr. Cohen the cure
    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Quarantine"
    New Mission: "Noveria: Rift Station"

22 - The Matriarch
Enter the secure labs to begin your confrontation with Benezia.  During the 
first part of the battle she will call in geth and asari reinforcements 
periodically, so your best bet is to avoid her entirely and concentrate on 
her servants.  To do this, follow the lower path towards the west side of the 
lab.  Find some cover and fight off the asari commandos and geth snipers she 
calls in.  When you defeat the last of her guards she will be out of energy 
and you can confront her.  After a revealing conversation she loses control 
once more and you must fight her face to face.  This time the best strategy 
is to attack her with everything your squad has.  The faster you can 
eliminate her, the better, as you still have to worry about the asari 
commandos she brings in to flank you.  Disabling powers like Lift can help 
keep her from using her powers against you.  If you fail to act quickly you 
can easily be overwhelmed.  Once she is defeated, mop up her remaining 
servants to conclude the battle.

    "Noveria: Matriarch Benezia" -> "Noveria: Death of a Matriarch"

23 - The Rachni Queen
There is still the matter of the queen that was being used to repopulate the 
rachni species.  Speaking through a dying asari commando, the queen tells you 
that her children in the hot labs have gone mad because they cannot hear 
their mother.  They cannot be saved, and she asks that you destroy them, if 
you have not already.  Now you must decide whether or not to kill the queen 
and exterminate the rachni for good.

    +24 Paragon - Spare the rachni queen
    +25 Renegade - Exterminate the rachni queen
    Mission Complete: "Noveria: Rift Station"

24 - The Hot Labs (Optional)
You are now free to fulfill the queen's request and eliminate the rachni in 
the facility--if you have not done so already.  You can also ignore the 
request and simply leave via the tram car.  This will lead Noveria's 
executive board to bomb the Peak 15 site to contain the rachni threat.  Head 
down to the hot labs via the elevator from the lower level and speak with 
Yaroslev Tartakovsy.  He wants you to set off the neutron purge to cleanse 
the station of the rachni.  Before he can give you the code he is slain by a 
rachni soldier.  Slay the creature and then collect the code from 
Tartakovsy's body.  Head to the back of the lab and access the Mira terminal.  
Give her the code to begin the countdown.  Several rachni will appear in the 
main room.  If you have trouble defeating them, your best bet is simply to 
make a run for the elevator and escape before time runs out.  Biotic powers 
will help you clear a path.

    Mission Complete: "Noveria: The Hot Labs"

25 - Return to the Normandy
Take the tram car to leave Noveria.  You have a brief meeting in the comm 
room with your crew to discuss Benezia's information.  Once again you can 
talk to the Council if you wish.

    +2 Paragon - "They won't." / "It was the only way."

1 - Insertion
Wrap up any outstanding assignments you want to complete and head to the 
Sentry Omega Cluster.  Joker informs you that the Normandy can't get to the 
infiltration team because of an anti-air defense tower in the area.  You will 
need to land in the Mako and take down the defenses so the Normandy can land.

2 - The First Gatehouse
The path to the AA tower is mostly linear, but there are obstacles in your 
way.  First there are a small group of drones, and then some foot soldiers 
along the path.  Eventually you will reach a gatehouse.  Though you don't 
need to open the gate to proceed, this is good practice for the gatehouses 
you will need to clear out later, and there are some containers on the upper 
level.

3 - The AA Tower
Beyond the gatehouse is a geth colossus.  The path splits after this, but 
expect colossi and armatures in either direction.  Ahead is another 
gatehouse.  Destroy as many geth as possible before leaving the Mako to 
access the gate controls on the upper level.  Before you can proceed you also 
need to deactivate the AA tower so the Normandy can land up ahead.  There is 
one final gatehouse beyond the tower, beyond which you will find the salarian 
camp.

4 - Captain Kirrahe
Enter the camp and speak to Captain Kirrahe, the leader of the salarian 
infiltration team.  His mission was to reconnoiter a research base where it 
seems that Saren has discovered a way to breed an army of krogan.  You must 
put a stop to Saren's plan before he creates an unstoppable army.

    "Virmire" -> "Virmire: Saren's Plan"

5 - Wrex and the Genophage (Optional)
If you never picked up Wrex at the C-Sec Academy back on the Citadel, then 
you should have nothing to worry about here.  However, if Wrex is on your 
team then he is none too pleased that you plan on destroying the cure that 
could save his species.  More information on this conversation can be found 
in the Optional Assignments section.  Briefly, unless certain circumstances 
are met, you must use Charm or Intimidate to defuse the situation.  Wrex must 
not be allowed to endanger the mission, so if he cannot be brought into line 
then either you or Ashley will have to kill him.

    +28 Paragon - "These aren't your people!" [8 Charm]
    +9 Renegade - "Don't be so naive." [8 Intimidate]
    +28 Paragon - "I wouldn't do this otherwise." / "We are."

    +25 Renegade - "[Signal Ashley to kill Wrex.]"
    +2 Paragon - "Damn it."
    +8 Paragon - "I'm in Command."

6 - A Daring Plan
Kirrahe has been working on a plan to destroy the facility and put a stop to 
Saren's activities on Virmire.  He has rigged the drive core from his ship to 
act as a massive improvised explosive.  Unfortunately, the only way to get 
the bomb into the base is to fly it in using the Normandy.  That means 
someone has to infiltrate the compound and take down the AA defenses guarding 
it.  Kirrahe's teams will attack from the front to distract the geth forces 
while you sneak a small team into the base from the rear.  However, the 
Captain is short on men and he needs someone from your squad to coordinate 
between the teams.  You can choose either Ashley or Kaidan to go with 
Kirrahe.  The consequences for this decision are minor, so your choice should 
be based on who you want to bring with you when you assault the base.  You 
have the option of trading with Commander Rentola, though he only has a 
handful of items for sale.  He can be useful for clearing out your inventory 
however, as there are a large number of items up for grabs in the Virmire 
base.  Speak with Captain Kirrahe when you are ready to begin the mission.

    "Virmire: Saren's Plan" -> "Virmire: Assault"

7 - Shadow Team
There are a number of things you can do to assist Kirrahe's team, but these 
are part of an optional assignment and are discussed in detail in the next 
section.  If you are not interested in helping the other teams, simply press 
forward to the geth base to the west.  There are no new enemies here, just a 
few drones, geth soldiers of various types, and a handful of krogan.  The 
krogan are your biggest concern, as they are deadly to you and your squad 
members at close range.  Do your best to keep your distance, and use tech or 
biotic powers to disable them if they get too close.

8 - Infiltrate the Base
At the west end of this area you have two paths to choose from.  Entering the 
sewers to the south leads into the base through a backdoor onto the 
detainment level.  The more direct route lies to the north, which will take 
you directly to the warehouse and subsequent maintenance area.  Either path 
requires you to access a security panel, which one of your squad members will 
use to disable the base security and get you inside.  You also have the 
option of setting off an alarm on the far side of the base.  This will 
redirect the base defenders to make it easier for you, but will also mean 
tougher resistance for the salarians.  Putting the pressure on Kirrahe's 
teams might be too much for them to handle.  Once the doors are unlocked, the 
other path becomes closed to you.

9 - Saren's Experiments
If you entered from the south, take the stairs up to the storage room.  From 
here you can go up to the next floor to cell block B, where Menos Avot and a 
group of salarians are being held prisoner.  You can release them but they 
turn on you as soon as the cells are opened.  Go back down the next set of 
stairs to reach the elevator to the labs.  If you entered from the north you 
need to clear out the warehouse of indoctrinated salarians.  From here you 
can head outside to reach cell block A where you will find Ganto Imness and 
another group of captive salarians.  When you have dealt with them, head back 
downstairs to the elevator and take it to the labs.

    +8 Paragon - "All right. Let him out."
    +2 Renegade - "No." / "Sorry. I can't risk it."
    +2 Paragon - "I think I can trust you." / "I'm letting you out."
    +9 Renegade - "Too risky."
    +2 Paragon - "They're no threat."
    +2 Renegade - "Open the door and kill them." / "Eliminate them."

10 - Genophage Research
In the lab you will need to fight some krogan and asari scientists, as well 
as a number of husks.  Pick up the kits in this room, and access the medical 
station at the far end before proceeding west out onto the catwalks.  
Eliminate the nearby troopers and follow the path to the security office, 
where you will find Rana Thanoptis, an asari scientist who has been working 
for Saren.  She tells you about the indoctrination process, by which 
Sovereign--Saren's flagship--controls the minds of those who are exposed to 
it.  You can choose whether or not to kill her for her involvement with 
Saren.

     +9 Renegade - "Too late."

11 - Sovereign
Head up the elevator Rana unlocked for you.  In this room you find another 
beacon, like the one you encountered on Eden Prime.  Activate it to have 
another piece of the Prothean puzzle downloaded into your brain.  Upon 
returning to the elevator, you are confronted by a holographic image of 
Saren's flagship.  Sovereign reveals its true nature: It is not merely a 
ship, it is an actual Reaper!  It explains that the Reapers have existed for 
countless millennia, and will continue to eliminate advanced life in the 
galaxy every 50,000 years until the end of time.  Sovereign claims that the 
Reapers constructed the mass relays and the Citadel so that advanced 
lifeforms would develop along the paths the Reapers desired.  When the 
conversation is over, the interface explodes and Joker chimes in.  He says 
that Sovereign is on its way.  Time to get the hell out of there.

12 - To the AA Tower
The path back to the facility is blocked but a new catwalk is open.  Proceed 
forward and take down the geth destroyer and the group of krogan ahead.  
Follow the path around to the west.  In the distance you can see the AA tower 
you will need to disable.  There are a few more geth and krogan in the area, 
along with some rocket drones to worry about.  Use the cover appropriately to 
take them out without taking damage.  The krogan can be knocked off the 
nearby ledge with Throw if you are positioned correctly.  When all the 
enemies are defeated you can head up the ramp and deactivate the AA tower.  
This triggers two groups of reinforcements: Geth soldiers come up the ramp 
behind you, while another group arrives in the nearby elevator.  One of 
Kirrahe's teams will radio in and inform you that they are heading for the 
second AA tower.  Taking down both towers will allow the Normandy to land.  
Take the elevator up to the krogan breeding grounds.

13 - Set up the Bomb
Finish off the geth in this area and open the large doors to access the 
landing site.  The salarian team knocks out the other AA tower, clearing the 
way for the Normandy to arrive and unloaded the bomb.  When all seems to be 
going well, the soldier you sent with the salarians radios in to tell you 
that their team is pinned down on the AA tower and they won't be able to make 
it to the landing site without assistance.  The Normandy takes off and begins 
a holding pattern.  Pick a new squad (Kaidan and Ashley are unavailable) and 
open the large door to the west.  This area contains a number of geth hoppers 
and krogan for you to defeat.  Eliminate all the enemies and then head to the 
elevator at the far side.

14 - An Impossible Choice
As soon as you arrive at the top of the elevator the squad sees a geth ship 
fly past en route to the bomb site.  Now both Kaidan and Ashley are under 
heavy fire from the geth and you only have time to rescue one of them.  When 
you have made your decision, say your final goodbyes and either head up to 
the AA tower or back down to the landing site.  At either location you will 
face a tough fight against some of the more powerful geth forces, including a 
geth prime.

    +2 Paragon - "I'm sorry."
    +2 Renegade - "Of course it was."

15 - Saren
When all the geth are destroyed, Saren himself arrives and attempts to 
justify his actions.  You can use Charm or Intimidate to try to sway him, but 
a fight is inevitable.  Make sure your equipment is up to date.  Unlike most 
fights where cover is important you will likely want to stay mobile versus 
Saren.  Because he is flying on his glider, most of your offensive biotic 
powers are useless.  When Saren has taken enough damage he confronts you face 
to face.  The Normandy arrives just in time and Saren retreats on his glider.  
The crew escapes the planet just as the bomb detonates, destroying Saren's 
research facility for good.

    +2 Paragon - "Join me." [7 Charm]
    +2 Renegade - "Sovereign will betray you." [7 Intimidate]

16 - Back on the Normandy
There is a somber meeting in the briefing room as the lucky member of your 
crew laments your decision.  When the meeting is over you have the option to 
speak with the Council about the mission.

    +2 Paragon - "You need proof?"
    +2 Renegade - "Screw you!"
    +2 Paragon - "You have to trust me."
    "Race Against Time" -> "Race Against Time: Sovereign"

17 - The Infiltration Team (Optional)
You can now head down to the vehicle bay and speak with the remnants of 
Captain Kirrahe's forces.  You can also purchase equipment from Commander 
Rentola, provided Captain Kirrahe survived the mission.  The salarians will 
depart when you arrive at your next destination.

~~~~~~~~~~
THE CONDUIT

When you have completed all four main plot worlds (Therum, Feros, Noveria, 
and Virmire), Liara will finally be able to make sense of your visions and 
put all the pieces together.  The Conduit is on Ilos, a planet in the 
Terminus Systems that is only accessible through the Mu Relay.

Accessing the Galaxy Map at this point triggers a message from Ambassador 
Udina.  Apparently the Council has changed their minds and decided to go 
after Saren.  They are massing a fleet at the Citadel to head to Ilos.  You 
must hurry back to take part in the preparations.
~~~~~~~~~~


<a id="21a8re">SECTION 8 - Return to the Citadel                                     </a>


1 - "It's Just Politics"
When you return to the Citadel you will be taken straight to the Council 
Chambers.  It seems you were been deceived by the Council and the ambassador: 
They have no intention of risking a war with the Terminus Systems on your 
word alone.  Moreover, the ambassador has locked out all of the Normandy's 
primary systems to keep you from leaving the station.

    +2 Renegade - "You son of a bitch."

2 - Anderson's Plan
Back on the Normandy, Joker informs you that the Captain has asked to see 
you.  He's waiting at Flux.  Head to Doran's establishment in the Wards and 
find Anderson at a table near the bar.  He believes that Saren is the real 
threat you say he is, and is willing to risk his career and his life to give 
you a chance to stop him.  He has two ideas for getting the Normandy off the 
station: He can either raid Citadel Control and try to override the lockdown, 
or head to the ambassador's office and hack into his computer to revoke the 
order keeping the Normandy on the Citadel.  The choice is yours, though if 
you ask him to choose he elects to go to the ambassador's office.  Keep in 
mind that if his plan succeeds you won't be able to return to the Citadel.  
When you are ready to leave, tell Anderson to go ahead with the plan and then 
return to the Normandy.

~~~~~~~~~~
LAST CHANCE

If you have any business to clear up on the Citadel, now is the time.  Once 
you have escaped the station, you won't be welcomed back.

Additionally, once you are off the station you will want to take care of any 
offworld assignments you haven't yet dealt with.  Once you head to Ilos there 
is no turning back.
~~~~~~~~~~

3 - Fleeing the Citadel
One way or another, Anderson's plan is successful and you are able to escape 
the station.  The crew is behind you one hundred percent.  Time to head to 
Ilos and stop Saren once and for all.


<a id="21a9il">SECTION 9 - Ilos                                                      </a>


1 - Surface Tension
Your arrival on Ilos is just moments too late.  Saren has entered an 
underground facility in search of the Conduit, locking the doors behind him.  
Before you can proceed in the Mako you must navigate the planet's surface on 
foot to find a way to open the doors.

    New Mission: "Ilos: Find the Conduit"

2 - The Ruins
Due south in the ruins are a pair of geth armatures.  If you prefer to face 
them directly, be ready for a tough fight.  Take out all the nearby soldiers 
so you can concentrate exclusively on the armatures.  A combination of tech 
and biotic powers work well here.  If you can temporarily disable one 
armature using Lift or Stasis then you can concentrate on fighting the other 
one using your tech powers.  Alternatively, you can head west from the 
insertion point to reach a different part of the ruins.  Though this area is 
more heavily guarded, it also contains an armature control console that can 
be used to deactivate the armatures so you won't have to fight them at all.  
Proceed south to the next area where more geth are waiting for you.  Take the 
nearby elevator when all the geth are eliminated.

3 - The Security Level
The elevator takes you to a large room.  As soon as you enter, a contingent 
of geth will rush in from the opposite side.  Fortunately, you aren't alone 
in this fight: On either side of the room are a pair of armature repair 
stations.  With sufficient decryption skill you can activate each of these 
stations to summon an armature to fight on your side against the rest of the 
geth.  There is also a walkway near the entrance that you can use for some 
cover and a high vantage point.

4 - Prothean Security
Head to the back of the room and up the ramps to either side.  These paths 
lead to a security panel you can use to open the doors and pursue Saren.  A 
message appears but it is unintelligible.  Head back down and take the north 
path to reach the elevator.  This takes you back up to the surface where you 
can now enter the Mako and proceed through the open passageway.

5 - Constant Vigil
Following the straight path leads you to an energy barrier.  When you get 
close enough, another barrier appears behind you.  Your squad speculates that 
this might be a trap from Saren.  Exit the Mako and take the nearby elevator.  
At the bottom is a VI interface known as Vigil, who explains that Ilos was 
the last refuge of the Protheans.  Here they placed themselves in stasis and 
hid from the Reapers until it was safe to reemerge.  However--after centuries 
of waiting--there were too few survivors left to sustain their population.  
They spent their remaining years trying to find a way to defeat the Reapers 
should they ever return.  Because of the Protheans' efforts 50,000 years ago, 
the Reapers have been unable to return to the galaxy.  However, if Saren 
succeeds, Sovereign will be able to summon the other Reapers from dark space 
and continue the cycle of extinction.  The key to the Reaper invasion plan is 
the Citadel, which is actually an enormous mass relay connecting to dark 
space--the empty void beyond the rim of the galaxy.  Sovereign needs to 
activate the Citadel relay, but would be unable to attack the Citadel 
directly because it is too well defended.  Vigil explains that the Conduit is 
a backdoor onto the Citadel, which will allow Saren and his geth to penetrate 
the station's otherwise impregnable defenses and give Sovereign the control 
it needs to activate the relay.

    +2 Paragon - "That's monstrous!" / "You betrayed them."
    +2 Renegade - "It was necessary."
    Mission Complete: "Ilos: Find the Conduit"
    "Race Against Time: Sovereign" -> "Race Against Time: Conduit"

6 - The Conduit
Vigil gives you a copy of a special data file that must be uploaded into the 
Citadel's master control system to give you control of the station.  This is 
your only chance to stop Saren and prevent the return of the Reapers.  Head 
back up to the Mako and hurry after Saren.  You need to navigate the trenches 
to reach the Conduit, though the path ahead is crawling with geth.  Since you 
are in the Mako, your primary concern is the large number of rocket troopers 
you will encounter.  At the end of the trenches you can see the Conduit, 
which is just a small mass relay.  There is a limited time to reach the 
Conduit before the gate closes, so waste no time fighting the nearby enemies.  
Head straight towards the gate to be sure you arrive before time runs out.  
The Mako is captured by the relay and propelled across the galaxy to the 
Citadel... 

~~~~~~~~~~
I recommend that you try to finish the rest of the game on your own.  There 
is not long to go, and I don't want to ruin the ending for you.  If you 
really need help however, the rest of the walkthrough can be found in the 
Secrets section.  Good luck and congratulations on making it this far!

Given by:     Sha'ira in the Consort's chambers
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: none

1 - Meet the Consort
In the southeast corner of the Presidium you can find the Consort's chambers.  
Go inside and talk to the receptionist, Nelyna.  After your conversation, the 
Consort will ask to see you in her chambers, so head upstairs and speak with 
her.  Sha'ira tells you that a former client has been spreading lies about 
her, and she hopes you can convince him to stop.

2 - Speak with General Septimus
If you have gained access to the Wards by meeting with the Citadel Council, 
head down to Chora's Den and find General Septimus at a table near the back.  
Talk to him and convince him to stop spreading lies about Sha'ira.  It is 
possible to do so without using Charm or Intimidate.  He asks you to do him a 
favor by taking some information to an elcor named Xeltan at the embassy.  
This task is covered in the assignment: "Citadel: Xeltan's Complaint".

    +0 Paragon - "Straighten up." [4 Charm]
    +0 Renegade - "Get a grip." [4 Intimidate]

3 - Return to the Consort
Head back up to the Presidium and see the Consort.  She thanks you for your 
assistance and offers you a Prothean artifact as a reward if you also 
assisted Septimus by speaking to Xeltan.  If you find this reward to be 
insufficient, the Consort will also give you something special for your 
trouble.

    +2 Paragon - "Glad to help."
    +2 Renegade - "Let's talk payment."

4 - The Consort's Gift (Optional)
Take your reward and head to the Prothean ruin on Eletania.  Here you can use 
the trinket the Consort gave you to unlock the mysterious floating orb for an 
experience reward and some information on the Protheans.

Given by:     Doctor Michel in the med clinic
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Confront Fist

1 - Talk to Dr. Michel
Visiting Dr. Michel in the med clinic after you have helped her with Fist and 
the quarian results in a new assignment: It seems the doctor is being 
blackmailed by someone from her past.  She is supposed to deliver medical 
supplies to a merchant named Morlan in the lower markets.  Note that you must 
first speak with Dr. Michel following the shootout in the clinic for this 
assignment to be triggered.

2 - Pay Morlan a Visit
You need to go see Morlan at his shop in the lower markets.  Talking to 
Morlan about the medical supplies will trigger the appearance of the krogan 
blackmailer.  You can fight him, but by using Charm or Intimidate you can 
convince him to stop blackmailing the doctor, in which case he tells you he 
is just the middleman for someone named Banes.  Morlan doesn't know who Banes 
is so you need to ask Dr. Michel.


    +8 Paragon - "You should reconsider." [6 Charm]
    +9 Renegade - "Talk and you're dead!" [3 Intimidate]
    +2 Paragon - "Let's work this out."
    +2 Renegade - "Kill him."

3 - Return to Dr. Michel
Asking Dr. Michel about Banes reveals that he was contracted by the Alliance 
to do research in the Traverse.  You should ask Captain Anderson about him.  
Talking with Dr. Michel concludes the assignment.

4 - More on Banes (Optional)
Find Anderson--either in the docking bay or in the ambassador's office--and 
ask him about Banes.  The Captain reveals that Banes was recently found dead 
aboard a derelict scout ship.  You should ask Rear Admiral Kahoku about him.  
You can find the Admiral in the Citadel Tower--unless you have completed the 
"Citadel: Missing Marines" assignment already.

Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Complete one major plot world (Therum, Feros, or Noveria)

1 - Concern for the Unborn
In the southwest corner of the Presidium you can find two people arguing.  
Michael Petrovsky wants his sister-in-law to have gene therapy for her unborn 
child to help prevent a certain heart condition.  Rebekah is worried about 
the risks of such a procedure, and is reluctant to do anything that could 
harm her baby.  It is not possible to complete this assignment without 
persuading one of them to see the other's point of view.  Once you have 
convinced either Michael or Rebekah the assignment is complete.

Given by:     Samesh Bhatia in the embassy lobby
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Have evidence of Saren's connection to the geth

1 - Talk with the Diplomat
Near the embassy you can find Samesh Bhatia, a widower whose wife Nirali was 
killed during the geth attack on Eden Prime.  Apparently he is having trouble 
getting his wife's body returned to him for cremation, and he wants you to 
head up to the embassy lounge and speak to the man in charge of his case.  
Take the stairs and find Clerk Bosker in the lounge.  You can persuade him to 
release the body, or go back downstairs and convince Samesh to let the 
Alliance continue its research.  Ashley served with Private Bhatia on Eden 
Prime, so having her in your squad adds more dialogue to the conversations 
with Samesh.  Once either of the men is convinced the assignment is complete.

Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Colonist background, return to the Citadel

1 - Stop the Suicide
Shortly after you return to the Citadel, Lieutenant Girard will contact you 
about a fellow colonist who is threatening to kill herself in the docking 
bay.  Go there and get the sedative from Girard.  Approach Talitha and speak 
with her.  Taking three steps forward will be close enough to give her the 
sedative.  Taking too many steps without gaining her trust however will 
result in her suicide.  Usually when you have the option to take a step back 
you should take it.  Talk with her by opening up each avenue under 
"Investigate."  Using Charm or Intimidate is not necessary.  When you are 
close enough you can give her the sedative and end the standoff.  Return to 
Girard when you are done to complete the assignment.  Alternatively you can 
tell Girard to have his sniper kill Talitha.

Given by:     Jahleed near the offices in the C-Sec Academy
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Access to the Wards

1 - Jahleed Needs Help
A volus named Jahleed is looking for help at the C-Sec Academy.  He claims 
that his former business partner is trying to murder him.  The person in 
question is a salarian named Chorban, who you may have met already.  You need 
to go down to the lower markets in the Wards to see him.

2 - Talk to Chorban
Head to the lower markets and approach Chorban.  If you have never met 
Chorban before he will pull a gun and demand that you hand over the "data."  
A fight breaks out, after which Chorban will surrender.  Chorban tells you 
that he and Jahleed had been partners, and had stolen research data from 
their employer which they then used to create a device that could scan the 
keepers.  Jahleed was supposed to disseminate their initial findings, but it 
seems he has betrayed Chorban and is keeping the data for himself.  Since 
Chorban attacked you, you can kill him for Renegade points.  On the other 
hand, if you have met Chorban previously you will avoid the fight entirely, 
which prevents you from having the opportunity to kill him.  If he has not 
already, Chorban will offer you the chance to scan the keepers for him.

    +8 Paragon - "No more."
    +9 Renegade - "You're not leaving."
    "Citadel: Jahleed's Fears" -> "Citadel: Jahleed's Secret"

3 - Back to Jahleed
Return to C-Sec and talk to Jahleed.  He reveals that he was hoping you would 
kill Chorban for him.  He too offers to let you scan the keepers.  If you 
refuse to help, you can choose whether or not to turn him in to the nearby C-
Sec officer.  If you don't turn him in, you can persuade him to mend his ways 
and take the data back to the people he stole it from.  You can only accept 
his bribe if you keep him out of jail without persuading him using Charm or 
Intimidate.  Once the matter is dealt with the assignment is complete.

Requirements: Complete four plot worlds (Therum, Feros, Noveria, and Virmire)

1 - An Unusual Request
Elias Keeler is an Alliance diplomat who needs you to get him a certain 
mental stimulant so he can be on top of his game for an upcoming meeting.  
You can end the assignment immediately by persuading him that he is an addict

    +2 Renegade - "No. You'll go now." [7 Intimidate]

2 - Drug Running (Optional)
Head over to the med clinic, where there are two new items available for 
purchase.  You can buy the stimulant Elias asked for, and/or a depressant

Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Earthborn background, complete Therum, Feros, or Noveria

1 - Roots
Outside of Chora's Den is a shady-looking human named Finch.  He claims to be 
a member of your old gang back on Earth and wants you to use your Spectre 
status to get one of your own out of prison.  He needs you to convince the 
turian guard in Chora's Den to release the prisoner.

2 - The Guard
Head into Chora's Den and speak with the guard.  With sufficient Charm or 
Intimidate skill you can convince him to release the prisoner.  Doing so ends 
the assignment.

    +9 Renegade - "Make it negotiable." [8 Intimidate]

3 - Dirty Laundry (Optional)
If you fail to persuade the guard--or warn him about Finch--Finch shows up 
and threatens to destroy your reputation.  If you can't persuade him to back

Given by:     Schells near the Flux entrance
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: "Citadel: Rita's Sister and Chellick"

1 - Talk to Schells
When you return to Flux after completing the assignment involving Rita and 
Jenna, you will see a salarian named Schells get thrown out of Flux.  
Apparently he is working on a device that can be used to cheat at Quasar.  He 
asks you to help his research by using the device to win some games for him.

2 - Give the Device to Doran (Optional)
You can end the assignment quickly by giving the device to Doran, who will 
offer you credits as a reward.  Return to Schells and tell him what you did.

3 - Scan the Machines (Optional)
You can use the device on any of the machines in the casino.  Doing so 
slightly improves your chances of winning.  Any time you get more money than 
you bet it is considered a win.  Win five times to collect enough data for 
Schells to use.  If you win seven times however, Doran will become suspicious 
and throw you out.  Return to Schells with your results to finish the 
assignment.

4 - Hit the Dance Floor (Optional)
After you complete this assignment you can return to Flux to find Doran 
strutting his stuff on the dance floor.  Approach him and press the A button

Given by:     Suspicious Gambling Machine in the Flux casino
Location:     Citadel
Requirements: Access to the Wards

1 - Track the Signal
Examining the suspicious gambling machine at the back of the Flux casino 
alerts you to a mysterious signal being relayed throughout the Citadel.  You 
need to find each relay in order to trace the signal to its source.  The 
first relay is in the Wards Access corridor.  The location of the signal 
should be located on your map.  Investigating this source will lead you to 
the next one, located behind Barla Von in the financial district of the 
Presidium.  The final relay directs you to a remote area behind the emporium.

2 - The Source
You come upon an ordinary-looking terminal that turns out to be a full-blown 
artificial intelligence!  Distrustful of organics and sensing its imminent 
demise, it begins a self-destruct sequence.  Activate the console to try to 
guess the abort sequence.  The correct combination is Y-X-Y-A-X-A-A (On the 
PC the sequence varies).  Averting the self-destruct completes the 
assignment.  You also earn whatever credits the AI was unable to transfer 
away before you stopped the countdown.  Note that you can also avert the 
self-destruct by shooting the nearby power junction, but this does not grant 
you any reward.

cut her off during the interview with the option of hitting her for Renegade 
points.  If you choose to answer her questions, using Charm or Intimidate

Speak to Fai Dan at the Zhu's Hope colony to learn about the problems he and 
the other colonists face.  One major concern is the geth that are holed up in

coordinate attacks.  Destroying the transmitter would take a lot of the 
pressure off the colonists.

2 - The Tunnels
Head up the nearby stairs and follow the path north until you reach the steps 
descending towards the tunnels.  Bear right until you reach the room on the 
eastern side.  As soon as you enter there are two snipers at the far end of

package.  You now have a few choices.  You can return the package to Opold 
for the promised payment, which ends the assignment.  You can also decide to 
keep the package for yourself, which adds an upgrade item to your inventory.  
Going this route doesn't prevent you from using Opold as a store, but the 
hanar's buyer--a krogan named Inamorda--will be upset enough to ambush you in 
the docking bay.  You can also cut out the middleman and sell the package 
directly to Inamorda at the hotel for some extra credits.  Finally, you have 
the option of going directly to administrator Anoleis and informing him about 
the smuggling operation in exchange for a garage pass that will let you leave 
the port.

Location:     Pinnacle Station
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install Pinnacle Station DLC

1 - Shepard's New Place
After completing all the challenges on Pinnacle Station, Admiral Ahern gives 
you his retirement home on the nearby planet Intai'sei in the Phoenix System.  
There are lockers here where you can replenish grenades and medigel.  You can 
also check the personal computer to access a convoy in the System that will 
give you random items for a set fee.  Once you have used the convoy feature,

<a id="21b5bc">Assignment:   Pinnacle Station: Combat Missions                       </a>
Given by:     Admiral Ahern on Pinnacle Station in the Phoenix System
Location:     Pinnacle Station
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install Pinnacle Station DLC

1 - Getting Started
When you enter Pinnacle Station, head through the doors to the command center 
and speak with Admiral Ahern.  He will tell you to talk to Tech Officer 
Ochren to start a simulator mission.  Continue south to reach the observation 
deck where you can find Ochren, along with a Scoreboard Console you can 
access to check your rankings in each event.

~~~~~~~~~~
PINNACLE STATION COMBAT SCENARIOS

By talking to Ochren you can access several combat training scenarios.  There 
are twelve scenarios in total (four combat modes to choose from, each 
available in three different environments).

-> In Time Trial mode you must defeat all enemies as quickly as possible.
-> In Capture mode you must capture all designated objectives as quickly as 
   possible.
-> In Survival mode you must stay alive as long as you can against an 
   increasing number of enemies.
-> In Hunt mode the timer counts down, and you gain extra time by killing 
   enemies.

Below is a list of the top times or scores you need to beat in order to place 
first in each scenario.

    Time Trial  -  Warehouse      -  1:24.67 (to kill 20 hostiles)
    Time Trial  -  Tropical       -  1:20.94 (to kill 25 hostiles)
    Time Trial  -  Volcanic       -  1:54.61 (to kill 20 hostiles)

    Capture     -  Volcanic       -  2:00.53 (to capture 3 objectives)
    Capture     -  Tropical       -  1:58.67 (to capture 4 objectives)
    Capture     -  Subterranean   -  1:29.47 (to capture 3 objectives)

    Survival    -  Volcanic       -  1:31.83 
    Survival    -  Tropical       -  1:46.43
    Survival    -  Subterranean   -  2:20.57

    Hunt        -  Subterranean   -  35      (with 0:25 to start)
    Hunt        -  Volcanic       -  43      (with 0:10 to start)
    Hunt        -  Tropical       -  50      (with 0:25 to start)
~~~~~~~~~~

2 - Combat Simulations
To progress in the simulator you first have to get the high score in eight 
scenarios.  In Hunt, Capture, and Time Trial modes, just move as fast as you 
can, and use your radar to locate enemies.  In Survival mode find a corner to 
hole up in and use the environment to funnel your enemies into a small field 
of fire.  Once you learn the terrain of each environment the challenges 
should become easier.  Once you have beaten the first two scenarios in each 
mode, a third scenario in each mode becomes available.

4 - Ahern's Challenge
When you place first in all twelve scenarios, Ahern will approach you and 
offer a special challenge.  He has designed a scenario in the simulator based 
on a mission he took part in during the First Contact War.  Talk to Ochren to 
begin the simulation.  When the mission begins, head down the steps and go 
straight for the Data Bank in the middle of the arena.  Once you retrieve the 
data all you have to do is hold off the turian mercenaries for five minutes.  
There are two Surface-to-Air Defense Turrets on the north side you can 
activate, though they aren't much help against moving enemies.  You can 
retreat to the area in which you started the mission, or head to the south 
and pick off the enemies as they cross the two bridges.  Completing this 
scenario finishes the assignment.

Given by:     Vidinos on Pinnacle Station in the Phoenix System
Location:     Pinnacle Station
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install Pinnacle Station DLC

1 - Assist Lieutenant Bryant
After placing first in an event you exit the combat arena to find two of your 
fellow competitors arguing.  Guard Captain Vidinos is accusing Lieutenant 
Bryant of tampering with the simulator to get higher scores.  He agrees to 
leave Bryant alone if you can prove that a human is capable of beating his 
high scores.

2 - Your Reward
When you outscore Vidinos in the first eight scenarios he withdraws his 
charges against Bryant and lets you take one of his weapons.  Based on your 
choice, a leveled sniper rifle, shotgun, pistol, or assault rifle will be 
placed into your inventory.

Given by:     Nassana Dantius in a radio transmission
Locations:    Citadel, Sharjila
Requirements: Spectre Status

1 - Nassana's Request (Optional)
After completing one primary mission planet (Therum, Feros, or Noveria) you 
may receive a transmission from an asari diplomat requesting your assistance.  
Return to the Citadel and seek out Nassana in the embassy lounge.  She tells 
you that her sister has been kidnapped, and that she wants you to go rescue 
her.  You get also get this assignment by hacking into Yaroslev Tartakovsky's 
logs at the Peak 15 research facility on Noveria.

2 - The Pirate Base
Head to the Macedon System in the Artemis Tau Cluster and land on Sharjila.  
You will find the base to the north guarded by a large number of pirates, 
including several snipers in the guard towers.  There are more pirates inside 
the base itself, led by an asari.  When everyone is dead, head upstairs and 
check the desk on the second floor to obtain information showing Nassana has 
deceived you.  Note that you can go straight to Sharjila without speaking to 
Nassana first.

3 - Return to the Citadel
Go back to the embassy lounge and confront Nassana.  She admits that she was 
lying to you, but offers a reward for helping her anyway.  With enough Charm 
or Intimidate skill you can get her to give you a license for the Armali 
Council, which makes the Prodigy amp and Nexus tool.  Finishing the 
conversation concludes the assignment.

Location:     Chohe
Requirements: 80% Paragon

1 - A Sensitive Situation
When you have sufficiently proven your virtue by getting enough Paragon 
points, Admiral Hackett will contact you about a group of biotic extremists 
who have captured a research outpost and taken the civilians hostage.  The 
Alliance needs you to go in and stop the biotics while minimizing civilian 
casualties.  You can refuse the assignment if you wish.

    +2 Renegade - "That's not my problem."

2 - Save the Civilians
Receiving this assignment opens up the Cacus System in the Hades Gamma 
Cluster.  Land on Chohe and drive to the nearby science station.  To complete 
the assignment you must kill all the biotics in the facility.  The civilians 
tend to wander aimlessly, so be careful if you are trying to avoid collateral 
damage.  Your squad can actually be a liability here if you are trying to 
save the civilians, so consider keeping them back if you are having trouble.  
When all the biotics are dead you can report back to Hackett for an appraisal 
of your ability to save the hostages.

Given by:     Rear Admiral Kahoku in the Citadel Tower
Location:     Citadel, Binthu
Requirements: "UNC: Missing Marines"

1 - Kahoku Needs Help
When you report back to the Citadel at the end of "UNC: Missing Marines," 
Kahoku informs you that a shady group known as Cerberus was responsible for 
the deaths of his men.  He needs you to head to the Voyager Cluster and 
eliminate their research outposts.  Go to the Yangtze System and land on 
Binthu.

2 - The Cerberus Facilities
The drop zone is in the middle of three research facilities, which you can 
tackle in any order.  Each is guarded by two heavy turrets on the exterior, 
and each contains a large room with a square energy barrier in the center.  
Inside each energy barrier is a different set of test subjects--either 
Thorian or rachni--that you can release by using the appropriate console.  
Around the perimeter of the field are a handful of research technicians (with 
biotic powers) guarded by Cerberus commandos and the occasional Cerberus 
sniper.

2 - Kahoku's Fate
When you clear out the final facility you will discover Kahoku's body in the 
center of the main room.  Despite the nature of the creatures he was locked 
in with, the needle marks on his arm suggest a different cause of death.  
Once you learn the admiral's fate, the assignment is complete, and "UNC: 
Hades' Dogs" begins.

Location:     Chasca
Requirements: Spectre status

1 - ExoGeni's Dirty Laundry
A server node on the upper level of the Feros ExoGeni facility informs you 
about a connection between ExoGeni and Cerberus.  You will need to 
investigate the Matano System to learn more about this partnership.  Head to 
Chasca in the Maroon Sea Cluster and explore any of the structures to the 
southwest.  When you notice the husks it becomes apparent what has happened 
here.

    "Investigate Samples" -> "UNC: Colony of the Dead"

2 - The Fate of the Scientists
There are two civilian structures, but exploring these is optional.  All the 
buildings contain husks, but the science facility has a terminal at the back 
which suggests where they came from.  It seems that someone from the Cerberus 
group passed through the colony a few days before the colonists transformed 
into husks.  Once you learn this information the assignment is complete.

Requirements: Spectre status

1 - A Doctor in Distress (Optional)
With enough electronics skill you can hack the terminal in the upper floor of 
the Port Hanshan hotel on Noveria.  Doing so reveals a message to a doctor in 
the Newton System who is apparently in danger because his connection to a 
certain organization has come to light.

    "Doctor at Risk" -> "UNC: Dead Scientists"

2 - Finding the Doctor
Head to the Kepler Verge and land on Ontarom.  Nestled in a valley to the 
southeast is an underground facility guarded by mercenaries.  Eliminate them 
and head to the back room, where a soldier names Toombs is threatening to 
kill the scientist you came looking for.  If you have the Sole Survivor 
background Toombs will recognize you as a fellow marine from the mission on 
Akuze.  This adds some dialogue, but does not otherwise affect the 
conversation.  If you fail to persuade him to stand down, Toombs will kill 
the scientist and then turn the gun on himself.  Using Charm you can prevent 
their deaths, but with Intimidate you have the option of killing the doctor 
yourself.  Return to the Normandy to complete the assignment.

Location:     Unidentified Space Facility
Requirements: Complete Noveria

1 - The Rachni Express
Having finished "UNC: Listening Post Theta" you should have a good idea what 
has happened.  Automated cargo ships have been delivering rachni all over the 
galaxy, and you need to find their source in order to keep them from 
spreading.  Travel to the Gorgon System in the Argos Rho Cluster and land on 
the unidentified space facility.

2 - Stop the Shipments
The cargo hold is filled with boxes that make navigation difficult.  Remember 
how you got through the hold to the far side, as you will need to navigate 
your way back in a hurry.  On the far side of the facility are a number of 
containers and a terminal where you will discover that Cerberus has been 
conducting experiments with the goal of creating a new biological weapon.  
Arm the nearby demolition charge and run back the way you came to return to 
the Normandy and escape the explosion.  More rachni will appear in the hold 
but making it back to the ship is more important than dealing with them.  
Escape the explosion to complete the assignment.

Location:     MSV Cornucopia
Requirements: Complete Feros

1 - Board the Freighter
Out in the Caspian System of the Maroon Sea Cluster you can find a derelict 
freighter.  Board the ship to discover a small army of husks on board.  It is 
apparent that the entire crew has been transformed.  When you defeated them 
all, head to the cockpit and check the logs.  It seems the crew discovered an 
artifact that made them go insane: They flew straight into the Perseus Veil, 
where the geth no doubt found them and transformed them into husks.  The ship 
was then directed back into the Traverse for someone like you to find, 
perhaps as a warning to those who would venture into geth space.  When you

1 - Strange Readings (Optional)
When you first arrive on the Citadel you can decrypt the computer console in 
the ambassador's office to receive an assignment about some unusual energy 
readings detected in the Argos Rho cluster.

2 - Investigate the System
Go to the Hydra System in the Argos Rho Cluster and examine Metgos.  You 
receive a distress signal from the planet's surface.

    "Unusual Readings" -> "UNC: Distress Call"

3 - Find the Distress Call
Land on Metgos and drive to the location of the transponder signal, which 
turns out to be a geth ambush.  There are two geth armatures, two rocket 
drones, and three rocket troopers to eliminate.  Avoid the mine placed

1 - Diverted Supplies (Optional)
Head inside the freighter at the Zhu's Hope colony and access the terminal 
using your electronics skill.  You will receive a message informing you of 
several supply shipments that have been diverted to the Voyager Cluster.

2 - The Missing Probe
Arriving at the Amazon System in the Voyager Cluster triggers a message from 
Alliance Command.  It seems they lost a deep-space probe armed with a nuclear 
warhead and they need you to recover it before the unthinkable happens.

    "Investigate Shipments" -> "UNC: Espionage Probe"

3 - Find the Bomb
Head down to Agebinium and make for the homing beacon.  The signal is coming 
from an underground mining complex, suggesting that the probe didn't crash on 
the planet.  Enter the mining tunnels and head to the back.  When you enter 
the last room, a cave-in will block the path behind you.  The holographic 
image of a pirate named Elanos Haliat appears and taunts you.  You need to 
find another way out of the tunnels, but first you must disarm the bomb in 
front of you.  There are three hard points you must disable, each requiring 
either a long sequence of button presses (on the Xbox 360) or 100 omni-gel.  
There is a ten second timer, but it does not count down while you are 
disabling each hardpoint.

4 - Back to the Surface
Once the bomb is defused, head back out and bear left to enter the adjacent 
tunnel.  This path leads you back out of the complex to a hidden entrance on 
a ridge overlooking Haliat's camp.  You can try to snipe Haliat and his mercs 
from the top of the ridge, or head down the hill and hop in the Mako.  Defeat 
all the enemies in the camp to complete the assignment.

On the upper level of the ExoGeni headquarters on Feros is a terminal that 
can be accessed for information on some suspicious ExoGeni activity in the 
Maroon Sea Cluster.  Head to the Vostok System and examine Nodacrux.  Joker 
will inform you of a distress beacon on the planet's surface.

    "Investigate Facility" -> "UNC: ExoGeni Facility"

2 - The Overrun Facility
Because of the rough terrain on Nodacrux, getting to the science facility is 
actually the most difficult part of this assignment.  Check your map and plot 
a course through the valleys to the south.  Once you have traversed the pass 
due east of the facility you can find a winding path up the side of the 
mountain to your left that will take you directly to your destination. 
Approaching the science facility should tell why the distress signal was 
activated: There are Thorian Creepers surrounding the entrance, and you can 
find many more inside.  At the back of the facility are a few survivors.  

Speak to Dr. Ross to learn what happened at the facility, and then decide how 
to deal with the science team.  She offers you a bribe to keep her illicit 
experiments a secret.  If you don't accept then you will have to fight her 
and the other scientists.

Location:     Armstrong Nebula
Requirements: Spectre status

1 - Turn Back the Geth Invasion
Decrypting a geth terminal in the ExoGeni facility on Feros informs you of 
some suspicious geth activity in the Armstrong Nebula.  Travel there and 
Admiral Hackett will ask that you eliminate the geth outposts in each system.

2 - Gagarin System
Head to the Gagarin System and land on Rayingri.  Travel south to the overrun 
research outpost, which is on top of a large plateau surrounded by husk 
spikes.  Inside there is a weapons locker and a storage locker in the first 
room.  The main room is filled with husks.  There are also husks in the back 
rooms that will pour out when you approach.  You can find three crates and 
two malfunctioning objects in the back rooms.  When you reenter the main room 
you will find that a squad of geth troopers, destroyers, and snipers have 
entered from behind you.  Eliminate them and head back outside.  As you exit 
the facility, more troopers, shock troopers, and snipers will get dropped all 
around you by a nearby geth ship.  Hop in the Mako to make dealing with them 
easier.  When all the geth are dead you can move on to the next system.

3 - Hong System
Land on Casbin in the Hong System and head northeast towards the geth 
outpost.  Follow the valley to the north and then east to avoid having to 
navigate the rocky hills surrounding the outpost.  Geth snipers will jam your 
radar when you get close, so check your map to be sure of your heading.  The 
outpost is surrounded by geth snipers and rocket troopers.  Keep your 
distance as much as possible and take them out one at a time.  Once they are 
defeated, a geth dropship will begin depositing geth shock troopers in the 
center of the outpost.  It will continue providing reinforcements until you 
destroy it.  Fire on the ship, and once it is destroyed clear out the 
remaining geth and proceed to the next system.

4 - Tereshkova System
Head to Antibaar in the Tereshkova System and head for the geth outpost to 
the north.  Again, expect snipers to jam your radar so check your map to be 
sure you are going in the right direction.  The outpost is guarded by a geth 
colossus, along with more geth snipers and rocket troopers.  When the outpost 
is cleared out, reinforcements will begin arriving.  Expect to face rocket 
troopers, shock troopers, and a few geth primes.  Once all the enemies are 
defeated you are clear to move on to the next system.

5 - Vamshi System
The final known geth outpost in the nebula is on Maji in the Vamshi System.  
Approach from the southeast, where you can find a winding path leading up the 
hill.  There are numerous geth heavy turrets built into the hill so be alert 
as you make your ascent.  The outpost itself is defended by rocket troopers 
and snipers.  Reinforcements this time come in the form of a single geth 
colossus.  When all the geth are killed your squad will remark that you still 
need to find the primary geth base for this sector.  Return to the Normandy.

6 - The Geth Base
You can find the geth base on Solcrum in the Grissom System.  As you come 
over the hill to the east you can survey the base in the valley below.  There 
are two colossi and three rocket troopers guarding the entrance.  When you 
get inside, you must fight a geth destroyer and numerous geth stalkers.  
There is also a juggernaut on the second floor.  The assignment is finally 
completed when all the geth are destroyed.  There is a secure crate and an 
upgrade kit in the back room, along with a terminal that can be accessed to 
begin the assignment "Tali and the Geth."

anti-tanks outside.  Proceed into the facility and mop up the rest of the 
commandos and snipers. 

2 - The Shadow Broker
At the back of the facility is a terminal containing encrypted files on 
Cerberus.  Return to the Normandy and access the Galaxy Map to receive a 
message from a representative of the Shadow Broker, offering to pay you for 
the information you just recovered.  You can choose whether or not to sell 
the information.  Any response ends the assignment.

Given by:     Elevator newscaster during segment on biotic extremists
Location:     MSV Ontario
Requirements: Spectre status

1 - Board the Freighter
While riding in an elevator on the Citadel you may hear that Chairman Burns-- 
head of the Alliance Parliamentary Subcommittee on Transhuman Studies--has 
been kidnapped by biotic extremists.  Head to the Farinata System in the 
Hades Gamma Cluster and search for the MSV Ontario.  It is hidden, so move 
your cursor around and look for a twinkle of light to indicate its location.  
Once you find it, select a squad and board the freighter.  All the enemies on 
the ship have biotic powers, so adjust your equipment and tactics 
accordingly.  When you are first spotted you will have three minutes to reach 
the hostage before he is executed.  Head to the far side of the freighter 
when the main hold is clear of enemies.

2 - Negotiate with the Leader
Confront the terrorist leader.  If you can't persuade him to spare the 
hostage you will have to fight the extremists.

Location:     Mavigon, Klensal, Amaranthine
Requirements: Spectre Status

1 - A Person of Interest (Optional)
Decrypting the computer console in the C-Sec Academy offices gives you a 
message about an individual they are keeping an eye on.  She can be found 
near the emporium on the Presidium.

2 - Taking the Assignment
Helena Blake solicits you outside the emporium on the Citadel.  She wants 
your help removing two fellow leaders of a galactic crime syndicate.  If you 
refuse to do what she wants you will receive the assignment anyway along with 
some Paragon points.

    +8 Paragon - "No. I won't do this."
    +2 Renegade - "Not a problem." / "I'll do it."
    "A Person of Interest" -> "UNC: Hostile Takeover"

3 - Eliminate Crimelord #1
Travel to Mavigon in the Han System of the Gemini Sigma Cluster.  The 
syndicate hideout is on a hill to the southeast with three alliance heavy 
turrets outside that you should try to eliminate from a distance.  When the 
external defenses are taken care of, simply enter the building and kill 
everyone inside.  Expect to encounter half a dozen turian and krogan 
mercenaries in addition to the crime boss.  There are a number of containers 
you can loot afterwards, including four medical kits.

4 - Eliminate Crimelord #2
The second target is on Klensal in the Dis System of the Hades Gamma Cluster.  
Head south to the syndicate hideout, which is guarded by three mercenaries as 
well as two snipers in the towers surrounding the entrance.  Once again, 
enter the complex and eliminate the mercenaries inside.  When both syndicate 
leaders are eliminated you need to go see Helena Blake.

5 - The Final Crimelord
Go to the Fortuna System in the Horse Head Nebula and land on Amaranthine.  
Travel south to the engineering outpost.  You can find her just inside the 
entrance, guarded by her own mercenaries.  Though still the leader of a 
criminal organization, she vows to limit herself to gambling and smuggling 
operations.  With sufficient Charm or Intimidate you can convince her to 
disband the syndicate completely.  If you choose to try to arrest her, she 
refuses to go peacefully and you will have to kill her along with her 
henchmen.  She erects an energy barrier across the doorway which you can 
remove by shooting it.  Helena has some biotic abilities, and she is guarded 
by several human and krogan mercenaries and snipers.  When all the mercs are 
dead you can head upstairs and crack the hardened wall safe to get some extra 
credits.

    +8 Paragon - "Walk away." [10 Charm]

Given by:     Visit the Erebus System or access Listening Post Theta comm
Location:     Nepmos
Requirements: Complete Noveria

1 - The Rachni Horde
The Styx Theta Cluster becomes accessible after you conclude your mission to 
Noveria.  Heading to the Erebus System triggers an urgent distress call from 
the planet Nepmos.  Head down to the surface and proceed towards the source 
of the transmission.  A group of Alliance marines are pinned down by legions 
of rachni who are swarming out of the ground on regular intervals.  Talking 
to Lt. Durand reveals the tough situation they are in.  She asks you to help 
in any way you can.  Head over to the damaged generator and hook up the 
Mako's power supply to reactivate the turrets.  Then move your squad to the 
opening between one set of barricades and place yourself in the other 
opening.  From here, the combined firepower should be enough to overwhelm any 
rachni that come your way.  Fight off a few more waves, then speak to the 
lieutenant again to learn that the rachni are coming from an underground 
complex nearby.

2 - The Infested Mine
Disconnect the Mako from the generator and drive west to the mine entrance.  
Though it appears to be empty at first, groups of rachni will begin pouring 
out of the ground as you get farther into the mine.  Proceed cautiously and 
retreat when necessary.  The soldiers tend to appear in groups of two or 
three.  When the main cavern is clear, there are two side passages at the 
back to worry about.  Each passage contains a few more soldiers and an 
enormous rachni brood warrior.  Retreat back into the tunnels as necessary, 
and use your biotic powers to disable each rachni if you can.  Return to the 
Normandy when the mine is clear of enemies.

1 - The Alliance Listening Post
Go to the Acheron System in the Styx Theta Cluster and land on Altahe.  
Approach the listening post to find some rachni holes outside.  Each hole 
will spew a few rachni soldiers as you get close.  Stay in the Mako to make 
quick work of them.  There are a handful of rachni in the base itself, but 
nothing you can't handle.  Grab the containers at the back, and then access 
the terminal to learn that a shipment was received by the outpost a few days 
ago.  It is likely the rachni were delivered aboard this ship.  To learn more 
you will need to investigate the supply depot in the Gorgon System.

1 - Investigate the Freighter
The MSV Worthington is adrift in the Ming System of the Gemini Sigma Cluster 
and seems to be abandoned.  Hoever, the hold is filled with explosives which 
are set to detonate when you get too close.  Head to the southeast room and 
play the logs to hear someone named Julia say that she won't give up on 
Jacob.  To the northeast you can find the brain-dead Jacob, still on life 
support, as well as a log from Dr. Smith.  In the cockpit you can access the 
computer to hear the captain recount what transpired: It seems Julia went 
crazy after Jacob was nearly killed.  When you access all the logs, Julia 
shows up and attacks you with her biotic powers.  She will also appear if you 
turn off Jacob's life support.  When Julia is dead you can go back to Jacob 
and deactivate his life support systems (if you haven't already).

Locations:    Eletania
Requirements: Spectre status

1 - Find the Data Module
Admiral Hackett needs you to recover a data module from a downed probe before 
the geth can get to it.  Land on Eletania and head northeast to find the 
downed probe.  The data module is missing, however, as a space monkey has 
made off with it.  Four monkey colonies will appear on your map.  You are 
interested in the one to the north, which is next to a mining complex.  The 
monkey with the data module is at the very back of the mine in the 
westernmost room.  The geth show up when you try to leave the mine.  You will 
have to fight a full compliment of geth snipers, shock troopers, and a 
destroyer.  When you are finished, return to the Normandy to complete the 
assignment.

Given by:     Console in Executor Pallin's office
Location:     Presrop
Requirements: Spectre status

1 - Follow the Transmission (Optional)
You can decrypt a message from the computer console in C-Sec HQ that directs 
you to the Century System in the Hawking Eta Cluster.  Your arrival will 
trigger a message from Alliance Command about a group of biotic cultists led 
by a former Alliance officer.

    +2 Paragon - "Maybe I can reason with him."
    "Strange Transmission" -> "UNC: Major Kyle"

2 - Investigate the Compound
Land on Presrop and proceed southwest towards the biotic compound.  To access 
the building with Major Kyle you must attempt to enter the large structure 
first.  Speak on the intercom with a biotic cultist inside.  You can persuade 
them to let you see Major Kyle, or you can simply go inside and kill the 
cultists.  At the rear of the building is a control panel to let you in to 
see Major Kyle.  Head outside and go to the other side of the complex to 
enter the round building.  If you persuaded your way in you can proceed to 
the back and talk to Kyle without incident.  Shooting any of the cultists 
will turn the rest of them against you and make a diplomatic solution 
impossible.

    +2 Paragon - "He needs my help." [3 Charm]
    +2 Renegade - "He'll get you all killed." [5 Intimidate]

3 - Major Kyle
You can use Charm or Intimidate to persuade Major Kyle to turn himself in 
peacefully.  If you accept his terms you can leave without a fight.  Return 
to the Normandy to inform Admiral Hackett about the mission.

1 - Armiston Banes (Optional)
If you have completed the assignment "Citadel: Doctor Michel" then you should 
know about Armiston Banes.  Asking Kahoku about Banes reveals that he was 
found dead on a derelict scout ship by one of Kahoku's teams.  Kahoku sent a 
reconnaissance unit to the scout the system where Banes was found, but they 
have gone missing.  Kahoku wants you to look for them.

2 - Find the Recon Team
Head to Edolus in the Sparta System to begin the search for the recon team.  
Take the Mako north to the location of the distress signal where you will be 
attacked by a thresher maw.  When fighting a thresher, be sure to keep moving 
or use the jump jets to avoid its attacks.  Once it is defeated you can check 
on the bodies of Kahoku's men, who were doubtless lured to the thresher nest 
by the distress beacon.  Return to Admiral Kahoku on the Citadel to give him

Given by:     Admiral Hackett
Location:     Luna
Requirements: Level 20

1 - To the Moon
The Alliance needs your help.  It seems they lost control of one of their 
training VIs on the Moon and they need you to go in and neutralize it.  Head 
to the Sol System in the Local Cluster and land on Luna.  Drive to the 
Alliance training ground.  There are three buildings in this area, each 
guarded by a pair of heavy turrets.  You can tackle the facilities in any 
order. 

    +2 Paragon - "Was anyone hurt?" 
    +2 Renegade - "I've heard that before." 
 
2 - Penetrate the Defenses
Each facility has around a dozen drones of different types (mostly advanced 
assault drones) which are very tough and have strong shielding.  Try to lure 
out a few at a time and deal with them in small groups so you don't get 
overwhelmed.  Be prepared to retreat if you have to, as the drones tend to 
close in and attack you in groups.  Remember also that biotic powers are 
basically useless here, meaning Garrus and Tali are probably the best 
companions to have.  Make good use of all your tech powers to make dealing 
with the drones easier.  Save often to avoid having to repeat the whole 
assignment.  You will also find that the entrance to each building has a 
secure crate and a secure storage locker.

3 - The VI Conduits
At the back of each facility are two rooms, each with four conduits you must 
destroy.  Attacking the conduits results in one additional complication.  In 
the first building, the VI will release toxic gas into the room to try to 
poison you.  In the second, the VI will erect energy barriers over all the 
conduits, and across each door that you will need to shoot to get past.  
Finally, the VI calls in reinforcements in the final building when you start 
destroying the conduits.  When all twenty-four conduits are destroyed, a 
binary message appears saying "HELP", possibly hinting that your enemy may 
have been more than a mere VI...

4 - Specialization Class
You have now earned your choice of specialization class.  This new class will 
add available levels to your base class on the Squad screen based on your 
choice of specialization.  Your base class determines which specialization 
you have access to:

    Soldier:     Commando or Shock Trooper
    Engineer:    Medic or Operative
    Adept:       Bastion or Nemesis
    Infiltrator: Commando or Operative
    Vanguard:    Nemesis or Shock Trooper
    Sentinel:    Bastion or Medic

Each specialization class adds certain benefits, but you must add talent 
points into the specialization to acquire them:

Once you have sufficiently demonstrated your ruthlessness by filling up most

2 - Aggressive Negotiations
Head to Nonuel in the Plutus System and travel northeast towards Darius's 
compound.  Enter the building and speak with Darius, who is on the second 
floor balcony.  He is decidedly unimpressed with you, and takes your presence 
as a sign that the Alliance isn't serious about negotiating with him.  The 
only way to avoid a fight is to remain polite and give him everything he asks 
for.  Otherwise, the negotiations break down and you are forced to kill 
Darius and his guards.  When the negotiations are complete, secure an exit 
and report back to Hackett to complete the assignment.  As you might have 
suspected, Hackett secretly wanted you to kill Darius.  If you managed to 
swallow your pride and secure a treaty peacefully, Hackett is somewhat 
disappointed but agrees to abide by the terms of the agreement.

Assignment:   Wrex: Family Armor
Given by:     Wrex on the Normandy
Location:     Normandy, Tuntau
Requirements: Spectre Status

1 - Wrex's Armor (Optional)
During your third conversation with Wrex on the Normandy he will tell you 
about his father.  Evidently, there is a suit of ceremonial armor belonging 
to the Urdnot clan which he would like to retrieve.

2 - The Armor Collector
Head to the Phoenix System in the Argos Rho Cluster and land on Tuntau.  The 
base to the south is filled with mercs and pirates.  Clear it out and then 
head upstairs.  In the back room you can decrypt the wall safe to recover 
Wrex's armor.  If Wrex is in your party you can give him the armor now, or 
return it to him back on the Normandy.  Completing this assignment will help 
you defuse the Wrex situation on Virmire.

<a id="21b10a">Assignment:   X57: Avoid the Blasting Caps                            </a>
Given by:     Simon Atwell on Asteroid X57 in the Asgard System
Location:     Asteroid X57
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install "Bring Down the Sky" DLC

1 - Tread Lightly
While on X57, Simon Atwell may warn you about the live blasting caps near one 
of the fusion torches.  Sure enough, the eastern torch is surrounded by a 
field of proximity-detecting mines.  When you approach, the Normandy's VI 
informs you of the anti-vehicle demolitions and advises you to proceed on 
foot.  Exit the Mako and carefully enter the minefield.  To get past the 
proximity detectors safely, watch for the X indicators on your radar display 
and space yourself evenly between them.  If you move between two detectors 
with enough space on either side you will be able to pass without causing an 
explosion.  The blasting cap controls are guarded by a some batarian troopers 
rocket troopers.  Access the control panel to disarm the explosives before 
heading inside to disable the fusion torch.

<a id="21b10b">Assignment:   X57: Bring Down the Sky                                 </a>
Given by:     Asteroid X57 in the Asgard System
Location:     Asteroid X57
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install "Bring Down the Sky" DLC

1 - Collision Course
Head to the Exodus Cluster and enter the Asgard System.  An asteroid 
designated as X57 is a collision course that will destroy the human colony of 
Terra Nova.  There are three fusion torches propelling the asteroid towards 
the colony.  Disabling all three will prevent the deaths of millions.

2 - X57 Radio and Other Diversions (Optional)
Located on top of a hill in-between the nearest two fusion torches is a 
trailer with radio controls.  Activating the radio will broadcast the 
familiar Citadel elevator music into your helmet.  The trailer also contains 
a first aid kit, and you can check the logs on the table to learn about the 
broadcast.  Additionally, you can find a dead engineer on a hill to the far 
west, near his damaged vehicle.  To the far northeast you can also find a 
deserted camp, with a computer that directs you to a nearby explosives cache.  
This cache contains eight grenade storage containers.

3 - The First Fusion Torch
Each torch is guarded by a number of heavy turrets that remain shielded until 
you get within their range.  As you approach the first fusion torch, a woman 
tries to contact you on the radio, but there is significant interference in 
the signal.  Enter the nearby torch facility to find the controls that will 
deactivate the torch.  There is a body on the floor near the entrance.  
Opening the first door reveals the cause of his death.  Batarian extremists 
have taken control of the asteroid.  There are a half-dozen batarians to 
contend with--including a sniper on the far side of the room--as well as a 
pair of varren war beasts.  When all the enemies are dead, search the room 
for a grenade storage box and a storage locker.  Then head upstairs to find a 
secure crate and the torch controls.

4 - Kate
After disabling the first torch and you will be contacted by the woman again.  
Her name is Kate Bowman, a member of the science team in charge of bringing 
the asteroid to Terra Nova.  Yesterday it was hijacked by the batarians, and 
she holed up in the main facility with a handful of other survivors.  She 
needs you to disable all three torches to keep the asteroid from colliding 
with the colony.

4 - Simon
Head back to the main entrance to find Simon, another survivor.  He may warn 
you about the live blasting caps surrounding one of the torches, and asks 
that you try to find his missing engineers.

    +2 Paragon - "They're not all like this."
    +2 Renegade - "Why would they?"

5 - The Second Fusion Torch
Kate tries to contact you again when you approach the second torch.  There 
are a half-dozen batarian troopers inside the facility, as well as an equal 
number of rocket drones.  When all the enemies are defeated, find the crate 
and the storage locker on the first floor.  There is also a medical kit and a 
secure crate on the top floor balcony.  While you disable the second torch, a 
group of terrorists--led by the batarian called Balak--break into the room 
where Kate and the others are hiding.  When Kate refuses to tell him who has 
been disabling the torches, he kills her brother.  Balak then sends his 
lieutenant, a batarian named Charn, to find and deal with you.

6 - The Third Fusion Torch
The final torch facility is filled with cryo and fusion containment cells 
that should come in handy for defeating the batarian troopers, shock 
troopers, and varren war beasts inside.  The batarian shock troopers have 
access to offensive and defensive biotic abilities, so be careful when 
dealing with them.  Don't miss the storage locker on the first floor and the 
secure crate on the second floor when the fight is over.  Disable the final 
torch and head back downstairs to find Charn waiting for you.

7 - Charn
Charn wants to talk, but if you plan on killing him anyway it's best to 
attack him now while you have the element of surprise.  When the fight begins 
the two varren war beasts at the opposite end will charge you, and 
reinforcements will begin to trickle into the room from the main entrance.  
Expect several varren war beasts and batarian troopers, as well as a handful 
of shock troopers and engineers.  When all the reinforcements are dealt with 
you can find the key card to the main facility on Charn's body.  
Alternatively, with enough Charm or Intimidate skill you can broker an 
agreement with Charn.  He will willingly give you the key if you can convince 
him that you have what it takes to get rid of Balak.

    +8 Paragon - "Forget Balak" [2 Charm]
    +8 Paragon - "Don't be stupid." [2 Intimidate]
    +9 Renegade - "[Attack him]"

8 - The Main Facility
Destroy the turrets guarding the main facility and head inside.  There is a 
grenade storage box and an aid station near the main entrance if you need to 
resupply.  There is also another grenade storage box down the steps in the 
center of the main room.  Head up the stairs and into the main facility to 
trigger a fight with a large number of defense drones and batarian troopers, 
shock troopers, and engineers.  Climb the nearby stairs to reach the balcony 
on the second level where you can find more cover.  Stay put and let the 
enemies come to you when the fight starts.  When the fighting dies down a bit 
you can leave your position and mop up any remaining enemies.

9 - Balak
When all the batarians are dealt with, Balak appears.  Knowing you won't just 
let him leave, he has locked the remaining prisoners in a holding cell with a 
bomb.  If you choose to attack Balak anyway, he will kill the hostages, then 
erect a small energy barrier guarded by a pair of varren war beasts.  Balak 
and his bodyguards will run along the balcony to the opposite side of the 
room, where he will set up with a sniper rifle and try to kill you from a 
distance.  Rather than waiting for the field to come down and dealing with 
the varren, you can cut him off by staying on the first floor and sprinting 
to the opposite side of the room.  When all the enemies are dealt with you 
can confront Balak face to face.  You can kill him, interrogate him, leave 
him to die a slow death, or take him into custody for the Alliance to deal 
with.  Alternatively, if you decide to let him go free in favor of saving the 
hostages, you have ten minutes to defuse three bombs that have been placed 
around the facility while fighting off a few defense drones.

    +24 Paragon - "[Let him go to save hostages]"
    +25 Renegade - "[Attack him]"

10 - Aftermath
When everything quiets down, Simon shows up.  He offers you a reward for 
helping save the colony: You can pick light, medium, or heavy human armor, or 
a set of quarian armor.  If you have enough Charm or Intimidate skill you can 
also get Simon to give you his omni-tool.  If you saved the hostages, you can 
then go open the prison door and let them out.  Kate will speak to you and 
thank you for everything you've done.  When you've wrapped up your business 
on X57 you can return to the Normandy.  The next time you access the galaxy 
map, X57 will have moved, with a description indicating that the engineers 
got it under control and will soon be able to put it into orbit as originally 
intended.

    +2 Paragon - "Only temporarily."
    +2 Renegade - "Damn right I am." / "As hard as possible."
    +0 Paragon - "How about your omni-tool?" [4 Charm]
    +0 Renegade - "Hand over your omni-tool." [4 Intimidate]

Given by:     Simon Atwell on Asteroid X57 in the Asgard System
Location:     Asteroid X57
Requirements: Spectre Status, Install "Bring Down the Sky" DLC

1 - Looking for Survivors
Simon Atwell will ask that you examine three survey stations to see if you 
can locate his missing engineers.  First head to the transmission tower and 
repair it, which will mark all three stations on your map.

2 - Survey Station 1
Station 1 is located to the southeast.  There is a secure crate outside the 
station, as well as an aid station inside.  Here you can find the body of C. 
Hymes, killed by an explosion, along with the station's logs.

3 - Survey Station 2
Station 2 is located to the north, and contains a hardened crate and aid 
station.  There is no sign of engineer R. Montoya, but the logs indicate he 
saw signs of fighting and left to investigate.  Accessing the logs triggers a 
group of three defense drones that you must destroy.  Outside the station you 
can find a set of footprints leading off to the east.  Head east to find the 
body of R. Montoya, located at the bottom of a nearby crater.  Killed by a 
sniper, his body was never looted by the Batarians so you can find an omni-
tool on his corpse.

4 - Survey Station 3
Station 3 is located to the southwest, near the drop zone for the Mako.  The 
body of G. Mendel is near the entrance, along with a technician kit.  You can 
find an aid station inside, along with the station logs.

5 - Give Simon the Bad News
Talk to Simon after finishing your business on X57 to tell him what happened 
to his engineers.

In order to influence what items the Alliance Requisition Officer carries on 
the Normandy, you must purchase licenses for each manufacturer.  What follows 
is a listing of each manufacturer, along with the items they produce, and who 
you must see in order to obtain a license.  While it is tempting to purchase 
every license, advanced players may want to be more selective about which 
licenses they buy.  For example, buying only one license makes it more likely 
a specific item from that manufacturer will become available.

Assault Rifles

Low level players will want to look for an Avenger to swap for their Lancer 
because of its increased damage.  All rifles at this level have poor accuracy 
and shots-before-overheat ratings, so players shouldn't worry much about 
these categories.

Mid level characters have a broader choice of assault rifles.  The Thunder 
does the most damage, though this can reasonably be traded for the higher SBO 
and accuracy of the Raptor or Tsunami.  Players should find a rifle that fits 
their play-style and stick with it.

High level characters have the greatest choice in assault rifles.  The HMWAR 
should be the weapon of choice for those who can afford it, but the Geth 
Pulse Rifle is also a fine choice--if you can find one--due to its superior 
accuracy.  The Kovalyov is also a good choice for dealing high damage.

Shotguns 

The choice of shotguns for low level characters is limited, so players should 
look for a Scimitar as it deals the most damage:  The drop in SBO and 
accuracy at this level is negligible.

Mid level players should upgrade to a Katana because of its damage, even if 
it has slightly lower accuracy and SBO when compared to the Firestorm.

High level players that don't have access to an HMWSG should look to the 
Avalanche because of its extremely high shots-before-overheat rating, or the 
Sokolov, which does a high amount of damage.

Pistols

Low level pistol users should try to acquire the Stinger II from Cole while 
on Eden Prime, as it is a big improvement over the Kessler players start 
with.

Mid level players can then trade up for a Raikou, as it is clearly the best 
pistol available at this level. 
 
High level characters should try to acquire an HMWP, but failing this the 
Karpov is a good choice, as is the Brawler, which does less damage but can 
fire more shots before overheating.

Sniper Rifles

Low level players may want to stick with the Avenger, as it has the highest 
accuracy rating at this level.  More damage can be done with the Reaper, but 
at a significant cost to accuracy.

Shots-before-overheat doesn't vary much for sniper rifles, so mid level 
players should look to the Equalizer for high damage, the Striker for high 
accuracy, or the Naginata for a balance of both.

The HMWSR and the Punisher are the only sniper rifles to offer a full 2.0 SBO 
rating to high level characters.  Beyond these, the Volkov is a good choice 
for dealing high damage.

Light Armor

The distinct advantage of light armor is its tech/biotic protection, so that 
should be a major factor in choosing what armor to equip your character with.

Hahne-Kedar offers the best armor to low level human and turian characters, 
while Phoenix armor is best for Tali.

Rosenkov's Titan armor is best for mid level characters, though players 
valuing shields can also choose Ariake's Mercenary armor.

At high levels, Kassa Fabrication's Colossus armor offers the best damage 
protection for all characters, though players looking to outfit Garrus with 
high tech/biotic protection should look for the elusive Phantom armor.

Medium Armor

Medium armor offers a balance between the high damage protection of heavy 
armor and the high tech/biotic protection of light armor.

Hahne-Kedar's medium armor is the best available to low level characters, 
offering superior stats in all categories.

The highest damage protection for mid level characters comes from Titan 
armor, but the higher shields are offered by Ariake's Mercenary armor.

For high level characters the decision is between the superior damage 
protection of the Colossus armor, or the high shields and TBP offered by 
Armax Arsenal's Predator M armor.  Both are good choices, so players should 
empirically determine which armor better suits their style of play.

Heavy Armor

Only wearable by Wrex and humans with the Soldier class, heavy armor focuses 
on elite damage protection and shields but has little or no tech/biotic 
protection.

Mantis armor is the best option for low level characters that are able to 
equip it.

Titan armor is a good choice for mid level players, though higher shields can 
be found from Mercenary armor, or any of the Hahne-Kedar armors.

As with medium armor, high level characters must choose between the superior 
damage protection of the Colossus armor, or the high shields and tech/biotic 
protection offered by Predator H armor.  Players should experiment and 
determine which armor works better for them.

Bio-Amps

The best bio-amp is the Savant, though it doesn't become available until 
players reach a high level.  For lower level players, the Polaris is the best 
overall amp.

Omni-Tools

The Savant is the best omni-tool available to players of a sufficient level.  
Low level players should look for a Nexus Tool to enhance tech cooldowns, the 
Logic Arrest Tool for good shield and medical bonuses, or the Polaris tool 
for a balance of both.

Grenade Upgrades

The best all-around grenade upgrade is the High Explosive upgrade, though 
other choices can be appropriate depending on the situation.  Fusion 
Explosives should be limited to use against organic enemies, and Cryo 
Explosives should be reserved for enemies with firearms.

==================

<a id="32agen">GENERAL STRATEGIES                                                    </a>
------------------

1. Save! 
The autosave system in Mass Effect can be very lacking.  Save often--and in 
multiple slots--to avoid losing too much progress if you should get killed or 
encounter a glitch.


2. Know your Class
Each class in Mass Effect has strengths and weaknesses.  Soldiers are the 
best at using weapons, and have access to heavy armor, but lack tech or 
biotic powers.  Engineers do well against synthetics like the geth and have 
the useful Decryption and Electronics abilities, but aren't the best when it 
comes to combat.  Adepts are best at disabling opponents with their biotic 
powers, but don't do as well using conventional weapons.

If you are a Soldier, you are more than capable of handling most enemies that 
come your way.  The biggest downside to playing as a Soldier is the lack of 
other abilities, so consider bringing along tech and biotic characters for 
balance.

One of the big advantages to playing as an Engineer is in the non-combat 
abilities like Decryption and Electronics, which can allow you to unlock 
doors and containers, or slice computer terminals.  Engineers aren't helpless 
in combat, however, and have the ability to disrupt enemy shields, abilities, 
and weapons.

Adepts are among the weakest classes when it comes to direct combat.  To 
offset this, you may want to upgrade your talents in as broad a spectrum as 
possible.  The more biotic abilities you have available, the more likely you 
will have one when you need it.  Adepts specialize in crowd control abilities 
like Singularity, which offsets any combat shortcomings.

The other three classes are hybrids of the first three.  Vanguards have 
access to weapons and armor training, but don't have the range of biotic 
abilities that Adepts have.  Similarly, Infiltrators gain weapons and armor 
training as well, but lack the range of debuffs possessed by an Engineer.  
The most supporting class is the Sentinel, which offers a mix of tech and 
biotic powers, but lacks weapon or armor talents.


3. Balance
Though it would seem that the more combat users you have in your squad the 
more formidable you would be, balance in your squad selection can be very 
helpful in most situations.

If you need to face a geth armature on foot for example, having a biotic who 
can diable it with Lift will be extremely helpful. Likewise, with a tech 
specialist you can disable its shields or overheat the weapons of any support 
troops.

There are also non-combat bonuses to having a balanced squad, like being able 
to hack into more difficult storage devices.


4. Know your Enemy
The strengths and weaknesses of your enemy are important to be aware of.  
Tech powers that eliminate shields and overheat weapons won't be of much use 
against the rachni, but can be a life-saver against the geth.  If you aren't 
sure what you're walking into, a balanced squad is the way to go.  If you do 
know what enemies you are going to face on a given planet however, consider 
bringing along characters suited to dealing with that specific enemy type.


5. Using Cover
Pressing your back against a wall is often the safest thing you can do in 
combat.  It provides you with protection, and allows you the ability to only 
fire when it is safe to do so.  However, there are some disadvantages, and it 
is important to be aware of them.

Not all enemies have ranged weapons, and even some of those that do have a 
tendency to charge at you.  You will frequently see krogan and geth 
destroyers running full speed up a hallway in an attempt to engage you at 
close range.  In these cases your best bet is to backpedal away, as staying 
in cover severely limits your mobility and opens you up to melee attacks.  
Powers like Lift can also be vital for dealing with charging enemies.

You may also want to stay mobile when you are facing a large number of 
enemies in an open area.  Sometimes big groups will try to surround you, in 
which case staying in one place isn't a good idea.  Cover won't help you if 
it's not between you and your enemy.

There's an additional concern when facing biotics, as they can lift light 
cover to take away your hiding place.  In these cases, try to find immobile 
cover like walls or immovable objects.


6. Using your Squad
This is certain to vary depending on your class, but a few general ideas 
apply when it comes to using your squad in combat.

First, you should always know what abilities each of your squad members has 
and how best to use them.  Depending on your settings, your squad may use 
many of their abilities on their own, which can usually take the pressure off 
of inexperienced players to make tactical decisions.  Remember however that 
certain powers--like Stasis--will only be used if you select them manually.

You can also use your squad for fire and maneuver tactics.  Sending your 
squad out front to take up a position near the enemy (but still in cover) is 
generally a good idea at the start of many firefights.  Enemies tend to focus 
their attention on whoever is closest to them, so having your squad protected 
but also drawing fire from the enemy frees you to flank and finish them.  
This is also a good technique for Infiltrators that are focused on sniper-
rifle combat.  Sending your squad up ahead can draw enemies out into the 
open, allowing you to deal with them from a distance.


7. Improving your Odds
On the higher difficulty levels some of the more aggressive tactics break 
down.  It becomes a bad idea to run out into open areas, or to fight enemies 
in places where they can surround you.  To make up for this, you can revert 
to the classic RPG tactic of scouting ahead to locate a few enemies, then 
retreating to a safe place where you can more easily destroy them when they 
follow you.  This is especially effective in narrow corridors where you can 
funnel enemies into a tight field of fire.


8. Using Equipment
Throughout Mass Effect you will collect an absurd amount of loot in the form 
of weapons, armor, and especially upgrades.  Make sure you are outfitting 
yourself and your team with the best possible equipment at all times to 
maintain your competitive edge.

Remember that armor and weapons vary significantly by manufacturer, so the 
sophistication level of the equipment doesn't tell the whole story.  Be sure 
to look at the stats of each item before you equip it to make sure you are 
trading up.

A very important and often overlooked aspect of Mass Effect is the ability to 
upgrade your weapons.  You will likely find more upgrades than anything else, 
and you should put them to good use.  Though armor and weapon upgrades can 
provide general advantages to your gear, the ammunition upgrades can make a 
big difference depending on who (or what) you are fighting.  You can swap 
these out at any time, so be sure to keep a few different types of ammunition 
on hand.  As the situation dictates, you will be able to deal extra damage to 
synthetics, or bypass shields, for example.

Unused items go to waste and take up valuable space in your inventory.  You 
can only carry 150 items at a time, so any equipment and upgrades you aren't 
using should be sold or turned into omni-gel.  The latter is good for a 
variety of decryption and electronics purposes, but selling items can provide 
you with the funds to buy new and better equipment.

Some weapons can only be found by purchasing them, so be sure to pick up any 
licenses you come across to increase the range of items your requisition 
officer can carry.  Advanced players may choose to purchase only specific 
licenses, to increase the odds of a certain weapon or armor appearing in the 
requisition officer's inventory.

-------------------

1. Armatures
Fighting armatures and colossi in the Mako is considerably different from 
fighting them on foot.  In the Mako simply keep your distance enough to avoid 
their attacks by using the jump jets while you whittle down their defenses 
with the machine gun and cannon.  You can also drive the Mako into the 
armature to keep it from firing, or park the vehicle on top of it.  You can 
then get out and finish it off.  When fighting on foot you will want to take 
cover, as a single blast from an armature's pulse cannon can be lethal.  
Using your squad as a distraction is also a good idea, as the armatures tend 
to focus on the threat that is closest to them.  This will allow you to 
attack them without worrying about being hit.  Biotics to disable armatures 
and tech powers to lower shields are also very useful.


2. Asari Commandos
The biggest concern when facing the asari commandos is their biotic 
abilities.  In a group they are particularly deadly because they can disable 
you and take you out while you don't have a chance to fight back.  They can 
also lift light objects to take away your cover, and their defensive barrier 
power makes it difficult for you to damage them.  Upgrades that bypass 
shields are a good idea, since tech powers aren't particularly effective.  
Commandos have a resistance to biotics, but if your biotics work they can be 
extremely helpful for disabling the commandos before they can disable you.


3. Geth Heavy Soldiers
The destroyer, juggernaut, and prime are some of the most dangerous geth 
enemies you can face on foot.  Unlike the armatures which tend to stay in one 
place, these soldiers will often charge directly at you, firing heavy weapons 
and rockets in your direction.  Keep your distance and don't stay behind 
cover if they charge at you.  Like most geth, they are susceptible to biotic 
powers, so use these to disable them before they can do too much damage.


4. Krogan
Saren's heavily armed krogan troops can be some of the most formidable and 
challenging opponents you will face.  You will want to keep your distance as 
some will charge at you and engage you from close range.  They also have the 
ability to regenerate health, and are resistant to most powers.  The best way 
to deal with them is heavy and concentrated firepower.  Biotic powers that 
can disable them are also tremendously useful.  Have your squad target the 
nearest krogan and deal with it before any other enemies.  It is helpful to 
note certain ammunition upgrades will vaporize them, denying them a chance to 
regenerate.


5. Rachni Brood Warriors
These rare and fearsome rachni are a great deal larger than the soldiers and 
even more deadly.  Like all rachni you will face, equipping upgrades that 
increase your resistance to toxins should help, but it is most important to 
keep your distance and avoid melee stacks.  Using biotic powers can also help 
to disable the brood warriors and keep them from attacking you.


<a id="32cbos">BOSS STRATEGIES                                                       </a>
---------------

1. Fist
The weakest of the bosses, Fist can still be challenging because of the 
turrets guarding him, and the restrictive nature of the combat space.  Though 
there is cover in Fist's office, it can be difficult to get your squad in a 
good position to deal with him.  Fist tends to stay in cover, so concentrate 

your fire on his turrets instead.  If you added Wrex to your squad for this 
fight he can make it easier on you, since he can absorb considerable damage.


2. Matriarch Benezia
There are two phases to the fight with Benezia.  The first simply involves 
Benezia summoning asari commandos and geth to help her, while the second 
requires you to fight her directly (along with a few reinforcements).  The 
biggest challenge when facing Benezia head-on is that you are in such close 
proximity to her at the start, and taking cover is pointless because she has 
more biotic commandos coming in to flank you.  She can't easily be harmed by 
biotics of your own, and some tech powers are also useless.  Your best bet is 
to concentrate as much direct fire (and powers) on her as possible from all 
your squad members.  If you can take her out quickly, you will have a much 
easier time mopping up her commandos.


3. Saren
Saren has no weaknesses.  Tech powers will do some damage, but most biotics 
have no effect because of his glider.  It is best to stay mobile--using your 
squad to draw his fire--while you gradually whittle him down.  Using 
ammunition that does extra damage to organics will help.


4. Saren Reborn
Sovereign's avatar is a very different foe than the one you faced previously.  
He is now a synthetic, so you will need to adjust your upgrades accordingly.  
He also has a number of new abilities, as he will try to overheat your 
weapons and take down your shields.  Biotics are extremely effective for 
immobilizing him so you can more easily hit him with your weapons and tech 
powers.


5. Thresher Maws
The easiest way to defeat a thresher is in the Mako.  It is often best to 
just to keep moving--or use the jump jets to avoid its fire.  Beware of 
splash damage from the toxic spray, and don't let it emerge directly beneath 
you.  To improve your accuracy, zoom in with the turret and slow down or stop 
when firing the cannon.

<a id="34arom">ROMANCES AND SQUAD CONVERSATIONS                                      </a>
--------------------------------

While you are on the Normandy between missions you can talk to each of your 
crew members in order to learn more about them.  If you are a male you can 
also pursue a romantic relationship with either Ashley or Liara.  As a 
female, you can pursue a romance with Liara or Kaidan.

There is no real trick to the romances; usually being nice to the object of 
your affection is enough.  You can take advantage of opportunities to flirt 
at certain points, though this is not always necessary.

You only have the opportunity to talk to each member of your crew while you 
are on the Normandy, and they usually only have something new to say after 
you complete each primary mission world (Therum, Feros, Noveria, etc.).


++++++++++++++++++++
Ashley Williams

-> Conversation 1
Immediately following Eden Prime you can find Ashley in the crew quarters.  
If you resisted her inclusion in the squad while on Eden Prime she will be 
cold towards you, but you have the option to patch things up.  She feels 
somewhat guilty because she believes that if Jenkins were still alive she 
wouldn't have been assigned to the Normandy.  You can reassure her to make 
her feel more welcome.

    +2 Paragon - "You helped."
    +2 Renegade - "The mission failed."

-> Conversation 2
Ashley expresses her concern about having nonhumans on the Normandy.  She 
doesn't want them to have the ability to gather intelligence on the most 
advanced ship in the Alliance fleet.  If you're trying to court her it's a 
good idea to try to smooth things over diplomatically, even if you disagree 
with her position.  Telling her she is out of line will make her disinclined 
to speak openly with you again.

-> Conversation 3
You interrupt Ashley in the middle of a vid-mail from one of her sisters.  If 
you are a male and have been showing interest in Ashley then her sister will 
mention that she's seen you on the vids and thinks that you're cute.  
Otherwise, Kaidan will be the one who is mentioned in the message.  This 
opens up an avenue to talk with Ashley about her family.  You can learn about 
her father's military service, and how she had to help her mother raise her 
younger sisters.  Discussion of her father leads to his interest in poetry, 
and how she reads his favorite poem to his grave every time she returns home.  
She asks if her belief in God will be a problem for you.  If you're 
interested in courting her then it's best to be diplomatic here, even if you 
think she's crazy.

-> Conversation 4 
Ashley offers you a drink in commemoration of Armistice Day, the anniversary 
of the end of the First Contact War.  This leads her to reveal that her 
family was blacklisted because of her grandfather's actions at Shanxi during 
the war.  If you are trying to be nice to her then it is best not to 
criticize her grandfather.  You should also tell her that it isn't her fault 
and that she is still welcome on your ship.

-> Conversation 5
Around this time--if you have been showing interest in both Ashley and Liara-
-they will confront you in the comm room and ask that you choose between 
them.  Trying to keep both won't work for Ashley, who gets disgusted and 
leaves.  She also takes it much harder than Liara if you reject her.  If you 
choose Ashley, she expresses an interest in continuing your relationship when 
the mission is over.

-> Conversation 6
During the lockdown on the Citadel, your romantic interest will approach you.  
Dismissing them and saying you don't want to talk will effectively end the 
relationship.  Otherwise, they express their concern that you aren't being 
taken seriously.  You are interrupted by Joker, who tells you to meet Captain 
Anderson at Flux.

-> Conversation 7
Once you plot a course for Ilos, you have one final opportunity to have a 
private moment with your romantic interest.  They will confront you in your 
quarters before you reach the Mu relay.  Your responses dictate whether or 
not the two of you will wait until the mission is over to further your 
relationship.
++++++++++++++++++++


++++++++++++++++++++
Kaidan Alenko

-> Conversation 1
If you are male then Kaidan has nothing to say to you after Eden Prime.  If 
you are female however, then you have the option of speaking with him.  He is 
curious to know why you are heading to the Citadel, and you have the choice 
of filling him in on the Captain's plan.  You can also tell him that he 
helped on the mission, or lament your own failures.

    +2 Paragon - "You helped."
    +2 Renegade - "The mission failed."

-> Conversation 2
Kaidan is concerned that the Council isn't doing enough to help you track 
down Saren and stop the Reapers.  He also talks about his experiences at 
"brain camp" and about his relationship with Rahna and his other friends 
there.  If you are a female you can also learn about his romantic tendencies, 
and how he used to read books about space-faring adventurers who traveled the 
stars to earn the love of beautiful women.  He also asks if you get this 
personal with everyone on the ship, at which point you can openly declare 
your interest in him.

-> Conversation 3
If you are female, Kaidan expresses concern that you are cutting corners.  He 
tells you about the mistakes the Alliance made when first dealing with 
biotics: They brought in turian experts to teach those with biotic 
capabilities, and Kaidan had a bad experience with his instructor.  He may 
also inquire about a rumor that you are interested in Liara.  If you want to 
continue your relationship with Kaidan then it is a good idea to downplay any 
relationship you have with her.

-> Conversation 4
Kaidan continues to be concerned that the rest of the galaxy isn't worried 
about Saren or the Reapers.  He talks more about what happened to Vyrnnus.

-> Conversation 5
Around this time--if you have been showing interest in both Kaidan and Liara-
-they will confront you in the comm room and ask that you choose between 
them.  Trying to keep both won't work for Kaidan, and he will leave.  He also 
takes it harder than Liara if you reject him.  If you choose Kaidan, your 
next conversation involves his desire to get the Council on the side of 
humanity.  He also expresses an interest in continuing your relationship when 
the mission is over.

-> Conversation 6
During the lockdown on the Citadel, your romantic interest will approach you.  
Dismissing them and saying you don't want to talk will effectively end the 
relationship.  Otherwise, they express their concern that you aren't being 
taken seriously.  You are interrupted by Joker, who tells you to meet Captain 
Anderson at Flux.

-> Conversation 7

Liara T'Soni

-> Conversation 1
You can go to the med bay after picking up Liara to make sure that she is 
alright.  She thanks you for saving her from the geth, but is concerned that 
the rest of your crew does not trust her.  If asked, she will tell you about 
her research into the Protheans, which leads her to admit her fascination 
with you.  You can also talk about Benezia, and learn more about the asari.  
Liara discusses the rumors concerning asari promiscuity, and clarifies the 
misinformation about asari unions and relationships.

-> Conversation 2
Liara talks about how impressed she is with humanity, and with you in 
particular.  She may also ask about your relationship with Ashley or Kaidan.

-> Conversation 3
Liara asks how you are feeling, and says she is concerned that you bear too 
much of a burden for one person to carry.

-> Conversation 4
Around this time--if you have been showing interest in both Liara and either 
Kaidan or Ashley--the two of them will confront you in the comm room and ask 
that you choose between them.  Trying to keep both won't work for Kaidan or 
Ashley.  Liara takes it the best if you reject her, as she blames herself for 
misjudging your interest.  She is very embarrassed, and hopes that you can 
both put it behind you and move forward as friends.  If you choose Liara  
then your next conversation involves some more information on asari unions.

-> Conversation 5
During the lockdown on the Citadel, your romantic interest will approach you.  
If this is Liara, there is no way to back out of the relationship at this 
point.  You are interrupted by Joker, who tells you to meet Captain Anderson 
at Flux.

-> Conversation 6
Once you plot a course for Ilos, you have one final opportunity to have a 
private moment with your romantic interest.  They will confront you in your 
quarters before you reach the Mu relay.  Your responses dictate whether or 
not the two of you will wait until the mission is over to further your 
relationship.

Urdnot Wrex

-> Conversation 1
Talk to Wrex to learn about the krogan war with the turians and the 
consequences of the genophage.  He tells you how his people are dying but 
seem unwilling to do what it takes to survive.

-> Conversation 2
Wrex tells you about the time he saw Saren.  He was working with a large 
group of mercenaries that were raiding ships out in the Traverse.  They had 
been hired by Saren, but Wrex only saw him once.  Wrex had a bad feeling when 
he saw him, so he quit.  A smart move, because all the other mercs turned up 
dead within a week.

-> Conversation 3
When asked why he became a mercenary, Wrex tells you about how he tried to 
unite the clans so that they could focus on breeding in order to sustain 
their population.  He ran into opposition from his father, Jarrod, who still 
believed in the old ways of constant warfare.  Jarrod betrayed Wrex and 
killed those loyal to him.  Wrex was able to slay Jarrod, but he knew it was 
too late for the krogan.  He gave up on saving their species and left to 
become a mercenary.  If asked, he will also tell you about a promise he made 
to recover his family's long lost battle armor, something you can help him 
with.

-> Conversation 4
Wrex elaborates on his earlier sentiment that killing for credits is better 
than killing for a lost cause.  It is easier to just forget about the 
problems of the krogan than it is to try to fix them.  You can also inquire 
about his life as a mercenary.

-> Conversation 5
At this point you can ask Wrex about any adventures he has had as a 
mercenary.  He tells you about the time he was hired by a volus diplomat to 
eliminate a target that turned out to be another mercenary and a friend of 
his.  They battled for days but in the end neither one got the better of the 
other.

Garrus Vakarian

-> Conversation 1
Garrus thanks you for bringing him along on your mission, and talks more 
about why he left C-Sec: He felt that C-Sec's rules imposed too many 
restrictions and made it too difficult for him to do his job.

-> Conversation 2
You can ask Garrus about why he joined C-Sec in the first place.  He wanted 
to fight injustice, but also to make his father happy.  Garrus' father was a 
highly decorated C-Sec officer, and someone who always did things by the 
book.  His father talked Garrus out of receiving special training that could 
have helped him become a Spectre.  Garrus resents the C-Sec way of operating 
because he believes that the only way to take down Saren is to beat him at 
his own game.  You can agree or disagree with Garrus's viewpoint on the 
necessity of rules.

-> Conversation 3
When asked if he has any interesting stories from his days at C-Sec, Garrus 
talks about Dr. Saleon, a salarian scientist who was performing brutal 
experiments on the poor citizens of the Citadel.  He escaped the station, and 
Garrus has been unable to get anyone to track him down.  You can offer to 
look into it for him, but he asks that you bring him with you when you go 
after the doctor.

-> Conversation 4
Garrus expresses his concern that you may never find Saren, and asks if you 
are concerned that the Council might actually be protecting him.  He suggests 
that if you do find Saren you should kill him because he is too dangerous to 
be left alive.  You can choose to agree or disagree with this sentiment.

-> Conversation 5
After dealing with Dr. Saleon, Garrus thanks you again for bringing him 
along.  Depending on how you dealt with the Dr. Saleon situation--and how you 
handled your earlier conversations with him--Garrus may also have something 
to say about what he learned from the experience.  Your actions have helped 
to shape his character, and his words reflect this.

Tali'Zorah nar Rayya

-> Conversation 1
Tali expresses her admiration for the Normandy and discusses her interest in 
ships.  She can also tell you the story of the geth uprising, and give you 
insight into her pilgrimage and the quarian way of life.

-> Conversation 2
Tali's excitement has died down and she has become uneasy.  She isn't used to 
how quiet your ship is and it worries her.  On the flotilla silence means 
that something is broken and needs to be fixed.  You can reassure her that 
she is simply homesick and that she will feel better soon.

-> Conversation 3
Tali is sleeping better, but she still needs something to bring back to her 
fleet when she finishes her pilgrimage.  Her gift needs to be especially 
valuable because her father serves on the Admiralty Board.

-> Conversation 4
Tali comments that it feels like you are getting close to catching Saren.  
She thanks you for bringing her along and treating her like an equal.

-> Conversation 5
If you found the data on the geth from their incursion in the Armstrong 
Cluster then Tali will ask for a copy to take back to her fleet.  She says 
that new information on the geth will be invaluable to her people and that it 
would make a perfect gift for her pilgrimage.  You can choose whether or not 
to give her a copy.

<a id="34c10b">SECTION 10 - Break the Cycle                                          </a>


1 - Backdoor
The Mako arrives on the Presidium with a bang, taking out a group of geth in 
the process.  Pull yourself from the wreckage and head for the elevator.  
There are some husks nearby to contend with, but no other enemies in sight.  
Hop in the elevator to ascend the Citadel tower.

    "Race Against Time: Conduit" -> "Race Against Time: Final Battle"

2 - "Suit Up, We're Going Outside!"
By this time, Saren has access to the station's controls and Sovereign is 
coming in to activate the Citadel relay.  To make matters worse, the 
transportation system has been shut down.  The only way to reach the top of 
the tower now is to scale the outside on foot.  Head forward along the 
maintenance shaft, where you will be ambushed by a group of geth troopers.  
Next there are destroyers and krogan warriors to contend with.  Ascend the 
ramp to the left to enter the exhaust plain.

3 - The Dropship
To orient yourself, just look for Sovereign off in the distance and head in 
that direction.  Bear left and follow the passage to reach an open area where 
a dropship begins deploying geth soldiers in front of you.  You don't have 
the firepower to deal with the ship on your own.  Fortunately, there are 
three defense turrets in the immediate area that can deal with the dropship 
for you.  Two of the turrets can be turned on simply by activating them, but 
the third has an average electronics lock.  The more turrets you activate the 
faster the dropship will be taken down.  When the turrets are firing on the 
ship, simply find a trench to hole up in and fire at the geth that get 
dispensed onto the battlefield.  When the geth ship takes sufficient damage 
it will retreat and you can proceed.

4 - The Geth Turrets
Beyond the next passage is the exterior defense grid, where you will find 
several geth heavy turrets in addition to the large number of geth troopers.  
There are shields around the turrets, but they are exposed enough that you 
can still hit them easily.  If you don't want to fight the turrets you can 
dip into the side passage to the east to avoid them.  The passage is guarded 
by a large number of powerful krogan however, so you will have to pick your 
poison.  Beyond this area is a hatch you can use to reenter the tower.

5 - The Tower 
Back at the top of the elevator you must now fight your way through the 
remaining geth defenders to reach Saren.  Compared to what you have just been 
through, these remaining soldiers shouldn't provide much of a challenge.  
Head up the steps at the far side to interrupt Saren before he can do any 
more harm.

6 - Stopping Saren
Like last time, Saren is on his glider, and he takes the time to speak with 
you before your encounter.  This time however, you have the chance to put a 
stop to the fight before it begins.  It isn't easy, but with a enough Charm 
or Intimidate skill you can force Saren to give up on Sovereign and end his 
own life.  If not, you will have to fight him once more.  This fight is much 
like the one on Virmire, so remember to stay mobile and use every power at 
your disposal to take him down.  Despite Sovereign's upgrades, he is still an 
organic, so adjust your upgrades accordingly.

    +24 Paragon - "That's not true." [9 Charm]
    +25 Renegade - "It's never too late!" [9 Intimidate]

7 - The Council's Fate
When Saren is defeated, head over to the control panel and use Vigil's data 
file to regain control of the Citadel.  You open up a comm link to Joker, who 
is standing by with the entire Arcturus Fleet ready to come to your aid as 
soon as you unlock the mass relays around the Citadel.  The timing of their 
attack is critical.  Until the Citadel's arms are opened the Alliance fleet 
won't be able to attack Sovereign, and they will be targets for the geth 
fleet until that happens.  In the meantime, the Destiny Ascension--the 
Citadel's flagship carrying the Citadel Council--is under heavy fire from the 
geth.  You can bring in the Alliance fleet now to save the Council at the 
cost of many human lives, or you can hold them back until they can attack 
Sovereign directly.  The choice is yours.

    +28 Paragon - "Save the Council."
    +29 Renegade - "Let the Council die."
    +8 Paragon - "Concentrate on Sovereign."
    +9 Renegade - "Concentrate on Sovereign."

8 - Dark Energy
Bad news: Saren is dead, but his synthetic components aren't.  Sovereign is 
controlling Saren's remains in one last attempt to stop you.  Make sure your 
weapons upgrades are set to damage synthetics and that you are using the best 
equipment available.  Saren is much more mobile than before--akin to the geth 
hoppers--so you will need to keep on your toes to avoid being flanked.  Don't 
bother taking cover, move about and do your best to avoid his attacks.  He 
has a deadly rocket barrage when he is stationary, along with the ability to 
overheat your weapons and take down your shields.  The safest thing you can 
do is disable him using biotics.  As long as he is immobilized he won't be 
able to harm you and you don't have to worry about him zipping around the 
room.  When Saren is finally beaten your victory over Sovereign is assured.  
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ending sequence.


CONGRATULATIONS!  You've Completed MASS EFFECT!
